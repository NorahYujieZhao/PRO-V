scenario: AllZeroInputs
description: Set a=0, b=0, c=0, d=0 to verify zero propagation through AND gates and OR gate

scenario: AllOneInputs
description: Set a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1 to verify logic high propagation through all gates

scenario: FirstAndGateActive
description: Set a=1, b=1, c=0, d=0 to activate only the first AND gate

scenario: SecondAndGateActive
description: Set a=0, b=0, c=1, d=1 to activate only the second AND gate

scenario: BothAndGatesActive
description: Set a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1 to activate both AND gates simultaneously

scenario: AlternatingInputs
description: Set a=1, b=0, c=1, d=0 to test AND gates with mixed inputs

scenario: FirstInputsOnly
description: Set a=1, b=1, c=0, d=1 to test first AND gate active with mixed second AND inputs

scenario: SecondInputsOnly
description: Set a=0, b=1, c=1, d=1 to test second AND gate active with mixed first AND inputs
