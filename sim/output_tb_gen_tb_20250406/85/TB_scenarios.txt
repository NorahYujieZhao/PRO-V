scenario: AllZerosInput
description: Set inputs abcd to 0000 which corresponds to a defined output of 0 testing the ground state behavior

scenario: CornerCaseUpperRight
description: Set inputs abcd to 1100 corresponding to a defined output of 1 testing the upper right corner of the Karnaugh map

scenario: BottomRowSweep
description: Fix cd to 11 and sweep ab through 00 01 10 11 to test the defined outputs along the bottom row of the map

scenario: MiddleColumnTest
description: Fix ab to 00 and vary cd through valid combinations testing the middle column transitions

scenario: RightmostColumnSweep
description: Set ab to 10 and sweep cd through all combinations to verify the rightmost column behavior

scenario: LeftColumnDefinedCases
description: Fix ab to 01 and test cd combinations that have defined outputs avoiding dont care entries

scenario: AlternatingBitsPattern
description: Test input combinations 0101 and 1010 which both have defined outputs of 0 and 1 respectively

scenario: BoundaryTransition
description: Test transition between adjacent cells with defined outputs focusing on the boundary between 0 and 1 regions
