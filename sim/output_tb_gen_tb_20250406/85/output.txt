The case AllZeroInputs does not match the specification
the reasoning is For input 0000, K-map shows output should be 0, but implementation outputs 1
the input variable is a=0,b=0,c=0,d=0
The present output is 1
The correct output is 0
The case TopRowSweep does not match the specification
the reasoning is For cd=00, only ab=10 and ab=11 should output 1, but implementation shows all 1s
the input variable is ab=01/00 with cd=00
The present output is 1,1
The correct output is d,0
