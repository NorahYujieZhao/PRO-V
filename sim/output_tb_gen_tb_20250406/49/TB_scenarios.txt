scenario: AllZeros
description: Set all 255 bits to 0 to verify the base case where count should be minimum

scenario: AllOnes
description: Set all 255 bits to 1 to verify the maximum count case

scenario: AlternatingBits
description: Set input to alternating pattern of 1s and 0s starting with 1 to test balanced distribution

scenario: SingleOneAtMSB
description: Set only the MSB bit 254 to 1 and all others to 0 to verify edge bit detection

scenario: SingleOneAtLSB
description: Set only the LSB bit 0 to 1 and all others to 0 to verify edge bit detection

scenario: OnesInLowerHalf
description: Set all bits in lower 127 positions to 1 and upper bits to 0 to test sectional counting

scenario: OnesInUpperHalf
description: Set all bits in upper 128 positions to 1 and lower bits to 0 to test sectional counting

scenario: SparseOnes
description: Set every 8th bit to 1 starting from bit 0 with all others 0 to test distributed counting
