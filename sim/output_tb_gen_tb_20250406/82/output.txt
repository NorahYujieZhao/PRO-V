The case TestbenchFormat does not match the specification
the reasoning is The testbench shows Python error traces instead of input/output test vectors. It's trying to access 'clock cycles' which is inappropriate for combinational logic.
the input variable is N/A - testbench format error
The present output is Error trace instead of test vectors
The correct output is Should be JSON format with input x[4:1] combinations and corresponding output values
The case CombinationalBehavior does not match the specification
the reasoning is The testbench erroneously includes clock cycles which suggests sequential logic testing, but the specification describes purely combinational logic
the input variable is N/A - incorrect logic type assumption
The present output is Sequential logic testing framework
The correct output is Should use combinational logic testing framework without clock cycles
