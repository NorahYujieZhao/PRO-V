scenario: BasicOperation
description: Verify the basic functionality by observing the output for multiple cycles to ensure it maintains a constant LOW

scenario: PowerOnBehavior
description: Check the output immediately after power on to ensure it starts in the correct LOW state

scenario: LongTermStability
description: Monitor the output for an extended period to verify it remains LOW without any glitches

scenario: SimulationBoundary
description: Test the circuit behavior at simulation time zero and near simulation end to verify consistent LOW output

scenario: InitialState
description: Verify the output is LOW during the initial state before any simulation time advances

scenario: SystemReset
description: Check the output remains LOW when system reset conditions are applied

scenario: NoiseImmunity
description: Verify the output remains LOW even when simulation noise or system noise is present

scenario: StabilityCheck
description: Monitor the output for multiple simulation timesteps to ensure no transitional states occur
