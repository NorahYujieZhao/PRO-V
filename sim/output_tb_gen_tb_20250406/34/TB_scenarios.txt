scenario: AllZeros
description: Set a = 0x00 and b = 0x00 to verify basic addition of zero values and confirm no overflow occurs

scenario: AllOnes
description: Set a = 0xFF and b = 0xFF to test addition of negative one values and verify overflow detection

scenario: MaxPositiveNumbers
description: Set a = 0x7F and b = 0x7F to test addition of maximum positive numbers which should cause positive overflow

scenario: MaxNegativeNumbers
description: Set a = 0x80 and b = 0x80 to test addition of maximum negative numbers which should cause negative overflow

scenario: PositiveNegativePair
description: Set a = 0x7F and b = 0x81 to test addition of maximum positive and minimum negative numbers

scenario: AlternatingBitPattern
description: Set a = 0x55 and b = 0xAA to test addition with alternating bit patterns

scenario: SmallPositiveNumbers
description: Set a = 0x01 and b = 0x02 to verify basic addition of small positive numbers with no overflow

scenario: SmallNegativeNumbers
description: Set a = 0xFE and b = 0xFD to verify basic addition of small negative numbers with no overflow
