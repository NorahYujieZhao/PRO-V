scenario: StateATransitions
description: From state A y321=000 test both transitions with w=0 to B and w=1 staying in A

scenario: StateBTransitions
description: From state B y321=001 verify transitions with w=0 to C and w=1 to D

scenario: StateCTransitions
description: From state C y321=010 check transitions with w=0 to E and w=1 to D

scenario: StateDTransitions
description: From state D y321=011 verify transitions with w=0 to F and w=1 back to A

scenario: StateETransitions
description: From state E y321=100 test self loop with w=0 and transition to D with w=1

scenario: StateFTransitions
description: From state F y321=101 verify transitions with w=0 to C and w=1 to D

scenario: Y2BitTransitions
description: Focus on transitions where y2 bit changes like A to E D to F and F to A to verify Y2 output logic

scenario: MultipleStateTraversal
description: Test longer sequence A to B to C to E to D to verify multiple consecutive transitions affecting y2
