scenario: All Input Combinations
description: Test all four possible input combinations (00,01,10,11) to verify correct NOR gate truth table implementation

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test all possible input transitions between states to verify proper output changes and no glitches

scenario: Simultaneous Input Changes
description: Change both inputs simultaneously to verify correct output behavior during concurrent transitions

scenario: Propagation Delay
description: Measure the delay between input changes and output response to verify timing requirements

scenario: Input Signal Stability
description: Maintain stable inputs for extended periods to verify output stability and absence of unexpected transitions
