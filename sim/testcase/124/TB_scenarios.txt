scenario: Basic Output Verification
description: Check that the output 'one' is logic high (1) immediately after module instantiation

scenario: Power-on State
description: Verify the output initializes to 1 at power-on without any delays or glitches

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: Monitor the output for an extended period (1000 clock cycles) to ensure it remains stable at logic 1

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify output remains at 1 across multiple clock edges to confirm no timing-related issues

scenario: Reset Condition
description: Ensure output maintains logic 1 even after system reset conditions are applied
