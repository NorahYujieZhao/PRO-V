scenario: Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal to verify FSM returns to OFF state (out=0) regardless of current state or input values

scenario: OFF to ON Transition
description: While in OFF state, assert j=1 to verify transition to ON state (out=1) on next clock edge

scenario: ON to OFF Transition
description: While in ON state, assert k=1 to verify transition to OFF state (out=0) on next clock edge

scenario: State Persistence OFF
description: While in OFF state with j=0, verify FSM remains in OFF state for multiple clock cycles

scenario: State Persistence ON
description: While in ON state with k=0, verify FSM remains in ON state for multiple clock cycles

scenario: Input Toggle
description: Rapidly toggle j and k inputs to verify correct state transitions and output stability

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Test j/k input changes close to clock edge to verify setup time requirements are met

scenario: Reset During Transition
description: Assert reset during state transition to verify immediate return to OFF state
