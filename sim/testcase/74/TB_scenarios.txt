scenario: Basic Load and Countdown
description: Load counter with value 0x010 and verify it counts down to zero over exactly 16 clock cycles, asserting tc when reaching zero

scenario: Zero Load Value
description: Load counter with 0x000, verify tc asserts immediately and stays asserted until a non-zero value is loaded

scenario: Maximum Count Value
description: Load maximum value 0x3FF (1023) and verify counter correctly counts down all the way to zero without missing any values

scenario: Mid-Count Load
description: Load initial value 0x020, wait 16 cycles, then load 0x010 while still counting, verify counter properly loads new value

scenario: Multiple Sequential Loads
description: Load different values (0x005, 0x003, 0x008) in consecutive clock cycles, verify counter always takes latest value

scenario: Hold at Zero
description: After counter reaches zero, continue for 10 more clock cycles without load to verify counter stays at zero and tc remains asserted

scenario: Continuous Operation
description: Load three sequential values (0x005, 0x003, 0x004) waiting for each to count to zero, verify proper counting and tc assertion for each sequence

scenario: Load Signal Timing
description: Test load signal assertion timing relative to clock edge to ensure proper setup and hold time requirements are met
