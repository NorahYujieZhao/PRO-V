scenario: Basic Signal Following
description: Verify output p follows input a when clock is high, and remains stable when clock is low

scenario: Transition Detection
description: Test 1->0 transition on input a during clock high period, verify q gets set on next clock cycle

scenario: No Detection on Clock Low
description: Apply 1->0 transition on input a during clock low period, verify q remains unchanged

scenario: Multiple Transitions
description: Apply multiple 1->0 transitions across different clock cycles, verify correct detection behavior

scenario: Reset Condition
description: Verify both outputs p and q initialize to 0 on first clock high period

scenario: Output Persistence
description: Verify q remains set until next clock high period after detection

scenario: Glitch Immunity
description: Apply quick transitions on input a during single clock period, verify stable output behavior

scenario: Clock Edge Timing
description: Test input transitions near clock edges to verify proper setup and hold time behavior
