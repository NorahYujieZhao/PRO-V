scenario: Basic Time Progression
description: Enable counter and verify normal time progression from 12:00:00 AM through several minutes with proper BCD formatting

scenario: Hour Rollover
description: Test transition from 12:59:59 AM to 1:00:00 AM and verify correct hour increment and BCD format

scenario: AM to PM Transition
description: Verify transition from 11:59:59 AM to 12:00:00 PM with correct PM flag assertion

scenario: PM to AM Transition
description: Test transition from 11:59:59 PM to 12:00:00 AM with proper PM flag deassertion

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset during random time values and verify immediate return to 12:00:00 AM

scenario: Disable Enable Signal
description: Toggle enable signal off and verify time freezes at current value regardless of clock cycles

scenario: Reset Priority
description: Assert both reset and enable simultaneously to verify reset has higher priority

scenario: BCD Format Verification
description: Verify all digits remain in valid BCD format 0-9 during transitions and rollovers

scenario: Long Term Stability
description: Run clock through multiple 12 hour cycles to verify stable operation and correct AM PM transitions

scenario: Invalid Time Prevention
description: Verify hours never show invalid values like 13 or 00 and minutes seconds never exceed 59
