scenario: Initial Power-up State
description: Verify the initial state and output values after power-up, ensuring they start at known values before first clock edge

scenario: State Transition with a=0, b=0
description: Apply a=0, b=0 for multiple clock cycles and verify state transitions and output q changes according to the pattern seen at 10-40ns in waveform

scenario: Input Pattern Sequence
description: Test the sequence a=0,b=1 followed by a=1,b=0 to verify correct output q transitions as shown at 45-60ns in waveform

scenario: Consecutive Same Inputs
description: Apply same input values (a=1,b=1) for multiple clock cycles to verify stable state and output behavior as shown at 95-110ns

scenario: State Toggle Check
description: Verify state signal toggles correctly between 0 and 1 based on input combinations as shown throughout waveform

scenario: Output Hold
description: Verify output q maintains its value between clock edges regardless of input changes

scenario: All Input Combinations
description: Test all possible input combinations (00,01,10,11) to verify complete state transition coverage

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify state and output updates occur only on rising clock edges as shown throughout waveform
