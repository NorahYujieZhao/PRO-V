scenario: Pattern Detection 1101
description: Input sequence d=1,1,0,1 to verify correct transition through states S->S1->S11->S110->B0

scenario: Reset Pattern Detection
description: Test pattern reset by inputting d=0 at various states (S1, S11, S110) to verify return to initial state S

scenario: Shift Enable Sequence
description: Verify shift_ena=1 through states B0->B1->B2->B3 after pattern detection

scenario: Counting State Operation
description: Check counting=1 in Count state and transition based on done_counting signal

scenario: Wait State Handshaking
description: Verify done=1 in Wait state and proper transition based on ack signal

scenario: Invalid State Combinations
description: Test with invalid one-hot state vectors to verify robust state handling

scenario: Fast Pattern Input
description: Rapid alternation of d input to verify no false pattern detection

scenario: Multiple Cycle Operation
description: Complete state machine cycle from pattern detection through wait state acknowledgment

scenario: Output Signal Timing
description: Verify timing relationships between state transitions and output signal changes

scenario: Concurrent Signal Changes
description: Test behavior when multiple inputs (done_counting, ack) change simultaneously
