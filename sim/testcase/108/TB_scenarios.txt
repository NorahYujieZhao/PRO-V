scenario: All Equal Values
description: Test all cases where A equals B (A=B=00, A=B=01, A=B=10, A=B=11), expecting z=1 for each case

scenario: All Unequal Values
description: Test all combinations where A differs from B (12 cases total), expecting z=0 for each case

scenario: Boundary Transitions
description: Test transitions from minimum (00) to maximum (11) values for both inputs, verifying correct equality detection

scenario: Adjacent Value Comparison
description: Compare each value with its adjacent values (00 vs 01, 01 vs 10, 10 vs 11) to verify precise comparison

scenario: Rapid Input Changes
description: Apply quick changes to inputs to verify stable output behavior during transitions

scenario: Simultaneous Input Changes
description: Change both inputs simultaneously to verify correct handling of concurrent transitions
