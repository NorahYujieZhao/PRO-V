scenario: Initial State Verification
description: Set a=1 and verify q initializes to 4 on first rising clock edge

scenario: Stable Output with a=1
description: Keep a=1 for multiple clock cycles and verify q remains stable at 4

scenario: Transition to Counting Mode
description: Change a from 1 to 0 and verify q starts counting up from 4 (4->5->6->0->1)

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: With a=0, verify q properly transitions from 6 to 0 and continues counting

scenario: Mode Switch During Count
description: Switch a from 0 to 1 during counting sequence and verify q immediately returns to 4

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify q only changes on rising clock edge and maintains value during clock low

scenario: Multiple Mode Transitions
description: Toggle a between 1 and 0 multiple times to verify correct mode switching behavior

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: Run multiple complete counting cycles with a=0 to verify consistent counting pattern
