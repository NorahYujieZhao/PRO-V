scenario: Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal and verify LFSR output initializes to 5'b00001 as specified in requirements

scenario: Single State Transition
description: After reset, verify one clock cycle transition validates correct tap positions (bits 5 and 3) and XOR operation

scenario: Maximum Length Sequence
description: Run LFSR for 31 cycles (2^5-1) and verify it generates all possible states except all-zeros before repeating

scenario: Mid-sequence Reset
description: Assert reset signal during sequence generation and verify immediate return to initial state 5'b00001

scenario: Tap Position Verification
description: Monitor bits 5 and 3 specifically during transitions to ensure correct feedback implementation

scenario: All-zeros Prevention
description: Verify LFSR never enters all-zeros state (5'b00000) during extended operation

scenario: Sequence Repetition
description: Run LFSR for multiple complete sequences (>31 cycles) to verify consistent pattern repetition

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify state updates occur only on rising clock edges and maintain stability between clocks
