scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: Assert shift_ena=1, count_ena=0 and shift in pattern '1010' over 4 clock cycles, verify MSB-first operation results in q=1010

scenario: Basic Count Operation
description: Load q=1111 via shift operations, then assert count_ena=1, shift_ena=0 and verify down counting sequence 1111->1110->1101->...->0000

scenario: Zero Value Counting
description: Set q=0000 and assert count_ena=1 to verify counter behavior at minimum value, ensuring it doesn't underflow below 0000

scenario: Maximum Value Loading
description: Shift in 1111 pattern and verify maximum value is correctly loaded before starting count operations

scenario: Control Signal Toggling
description: Alternate between shift_ena and count_ena across multiple clock cycles, verifying clean transitions between modes

scenario: Rapid Mode Switching
description: Switch between shift and count modes every clock cycle, verifying stable operation and correct mode selection

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify all operations (shift and count) occur only on rising clock edges with proper setup and hold times

scenario: Initial Power-up State
description: Check register contains valid 4-bit value (0000) after power-up without any explicit initialization
