scenario: Basic State Transitions with Input 0
description: Test all state transitions when input=0: A->A, B->C, C->A, D->C. Verify next_state computation and output values for each transition.

scenario: Basic State Transitions with Input 1
description: Test all state transitions when input=1: A->B, B->B, C->D, D->B. Verify next_state computation and output values for each transition.

scenario: Output Verification
description: Verify output=1 only in state D (11) and output=0 in all other states (A,B,C) regardless of input value.

scenario: State Encoding Boundary
description: Test transitions from maximum state value (11) to other states and verify correct next_state encoding.

scenario: Input Toggle in Each State
description: Toggle input between 0 and 1 while in each state to verify correct next_state computation and output stability.

scenario: Self-Loop Verification
description: Verify self-loop transitions (A->A with input=0, B->B with input=1) maintain correct state and output.

scenario: Complete State Coverage
description: Exercise all possible state-input combinations (8 total) to ensure 100% state and transition coverage.
