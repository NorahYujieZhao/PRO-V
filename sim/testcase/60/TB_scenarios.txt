scenario: Basic Counting Operation
description: Let counter run for multiple clock cycles without reset to verify sequential increment from 0 to 999

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset signal for one clock cycle and verify counter returns to 0 on the next clock edge

scenario: Reset During Active Count
description: Allow counter to reach arbitrary value (e.g., 500), then assert reset to verify synchronous reset behavior mid-count

scenario: Maximum Value Rollover
description: Let counter reach 999 and verify it correctly rolls over to 0 on the next clock cycle

scenario: Multiple Period Verification
description: Run counter for multiple complete 1000-cycle periods to verify consistent behavior across periods

scenario: Reset at Boundary Condition
description: Assert reset when counter is at 999 to verify proper reset behavior at maximum value

scenario: Initial Power-up State
description: Verify counter starts from 0 on initial power-up before any reset assertion

scenario: Rapid Reset Toggling
description: Toggle reset signal multiple times in quick succession to verify robust synchronous reset handling
