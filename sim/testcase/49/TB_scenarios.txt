scenario: All Zeros Input
description: Set all 255 bits to 0 and verify output is 8'h00, testing minimum count case

scenario: All Ones Input
description: Set all 255 bits to 1 and verify output is 8'hFF, testing maximum count case

scenario: Single Bit Set
description: Test with only one '1' bit set at different positions (0, 127, 254) to verify single bit detection

scenario: Alternating Pattern
description: Set input to alternating 1s and 0s (0x555...555) to verify counting of 127 ones

scenario: Random Distribution
description: Apply random bit patterns with known number of 1s to verify counting accuracy across different distributions

scenario: Walking Ones
description: Shift a pattern of consecutive 1s (width 8, 16, 32 bits) across the input range to test adjacent bit handling

scenario: Sparse Pattern
description: Test with few 1s scattered across input vector (approximately 10% density) to verify sparse pattern handling

scenario: Dense Pattern
description: Test with many 1s scattered across input vector (approximately 90% density) to verify dense pattern handling
