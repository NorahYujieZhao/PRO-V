scenario: Basic Valid Byte Reception
description: Send a complete valid byte (0x55) with correct start(0) and stop(1) bits, verify out_byte value and done signal assertion

scenario: Multiple Consecutive Bytes
description: Transmit multiple bytes (0xAA, 0x55, 0xFF) back-to-back with proper framing, verify continuous reception and done pulses

scenario: Missing Stop Bit
description: Send byte with start bit and data but incorrect stop bit (0), verify FSM waits for valid stop bit before next reception

scenario: Idle Line Recovery
description: After error condition, verify FSM properly resynchronizes when line returns to idle (1) state and can receive next valid byte

scenario: Reset During Reception
description: Assert reset while receiving data bits, verify FSM returns to idle state and can properly receive next byte

scenario: Bit Ordering Verification
description: Send byte 0x80 (10000000) and verify LSB is received first and assembled correctly in out_byte

scenario: Extended Idle Period
description: Maintain input high (idle) for multiple clock cycles, then send valid byte, verify proper start bit detection

scenario: Premature Start Bit
description: Send new start bit during data reception, verify FSM ignores it and completes current byte reception
