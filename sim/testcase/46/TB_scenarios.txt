scenario: Synchronous Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal for one clock cycle and verify q initializes to 32'h1 on the next clock edge

scenario: Basic LFSR Operation
description: After reset, run LFSR for 100 cycles and verify each new state follows the Galois LFSR formula with taps at positions 32, 22, 2, and 1

scenario: Mid-sequence Reset
description: Allow LFSR to run for 50 cycles, assert reset for one cycle, verify return to 32'h1, then continue for 50 more cycles

scenario: Full Sequence Period
description: Run LFSR until sequence repeats (maximum 2^32-1 cycles) to verify maximum length sequence generation

scenario: Reset During Active Operation
description: Assert reset while LFSR is shifting and verify immediate synchronous reset to 32'h1 on next clock edge

scenario: Back-to-Back Reset
description: Assert reset for multiple consecutive clock cycles and verify q maintains 32'h1 value throughout

scenario: Feedback Path Verification
description: Monitor bit positions 32, 22, 2, and 1 specifically to verify correct XOR operations and feedback generation
