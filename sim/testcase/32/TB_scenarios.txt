scenario: Single Bit Transition
description: Test 1-to-0 transition on individual bits across the 32-bit vector, verifying each bit is captured and held independently

scenario: Multiple Simultaneous Transitions
description: Apply multiple 1-to-0 transitions across different bits in the same clock cycle, ensure all transitions are captured correctly

scenario: No Transition Detection
description: Test cases where bits change from 0-to-1 or maintain steady states (0-to-0, 1-to-1), verify no false captures occur

scenario: Reset Functionality
description: Assert reset while various bits are captured, verify all output bits clear to 0 synchronously with clock

scenario: Consecutive Transitions
description: Test multiple 1-to-0 transitions on the same bit position over consecutive clock cycles, verify capture holds through subsequent transitions

scenario: All Bits Transition
description: Set all 32 bits to 1, then transition all to 0 in next cycle, verify complete vector capture

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: Apply reset, then immediately test transition capture on next clock cycle, verify proper initialization and capture capability

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: After capturing transitions, run multiple cycles without changes to verify captured bits remain stable until reset
