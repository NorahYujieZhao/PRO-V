scenario: Basic Prediction Operation
description: Assert predict_valid with different PC values and verify predicted_taken output matches PHT entry state. Check branch history register updates correctly after predictions.

scenario: Basic Training Operation
description: Assert train_valid with various PC/history combinations and verify PHT entries are updated according to train_taken value. Monitor 2-bit saturating counter behavior.

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Assert areset asynchronously and verify branch history register resets to 0 and all PHT entries initialize to weakly not-taken state.

scenario: History Register Recovery
description: Train with train_mispredicted=1 and verify branch history register recovers to train_history value, discarding any subsequent predictions.

scenario: Concurrent Predict-Train
description: Issue prediction and training requests in same cycle. Verify training takes precedence for history register updates and prediction sees pre-training PHT state.

scenario: PHT Saturation Behavior
description: Repeatedly train same branch pattern in same direction and verify 2-bit counter saturates correctly at strongly taken/not-taken states.

scenario: Index Hashing Verification
description: Test different PC and history combinations to verify correct XOR hashing into PHT index, ensuring all 128 entries are accessible.

scenario: Branch Pattern Learning
description: Train specific branch patterns and verify subsequent predictions match learned behavior, testing predictor's pattern recognition capability.

scenario: Multiple Mispredictions
description: Generate sequence of mispredicted branches and verify correct history recovery and PHT updates for each case.

scenario: Boundary Conditions
description: Test maximum values for PC and history (0x7F), verify proper wraparound and index calculation at boundaries.
