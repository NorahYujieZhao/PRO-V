scenario: All Zero Inputs
description: Set all inputs (a,b,c,d) to 0 and verify output q is 0, representing basic zero-input case

scenario: Single Input High
description: Test each input being 1 while others are 0 (4 cases), verify output q remains 0 as it's below majority threshold

scenario: Two Inputs High
description: Test all combinations of two inputs being 1 (6 cases), verify output q becomes 1 as it meets majority threshold

scenario: Three Inputs High
description: Test all combinations of three inputs being 1 (4 cases), verify output q is 1 as it exceeds majority threshold

scenario: All Inputs High
description: Set all inputs (a,b,c,d) to 1 and verify output q is 1, representing maximum input case

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test rapid transitions between valid input combinations to verify glitch-free operation

scenario: Propagation Delay
description: Measure output transition time relative to input changes to verify combinational timing requirements
