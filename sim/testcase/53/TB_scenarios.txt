scenario: All Input Combinations
description: Test all possible input combinations (00,01,10,11) to verify truth table: out = in1 AND (NOT in2)

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test transitions between all input states to verify glitch-free operation and proper signal propagation

scenario: Setup and Hold Times
description: Verify setup and hold times for both inputs relative to expected output changes

scenario: Propagation Delay
description: Measure propagation delay from input changes to output stabilization

scenario: Simultaneous Input Changes
description: Test behavior when both inputs change simultaneously to verify proper handling of concurrent transitions

scenario: Input Signal Stability
description: Verify output remains stable when inputs are held constant for extended periods
