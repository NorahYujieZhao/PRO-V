scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal for multiple clock cycles and verify all flip-flops are set to 0x34 on negative clock edges

scenario: Normal Data Capture
description: Apply various input patterns (0x00, 0xFF, 0xAA, 0x55) and verify correct data capture on negative clock edges without reset

scenario: Reset During Data Change
description: Change input data while reset is asserted and verify output remains at 0x34 regardless of input changes

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to negative clock edge to verify proper setup time requirements are met

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input data immediately after negative clock edge to verify proper hold time requirements are met

scenario: Reset Deactivation
description: Deassert reset and verify DFFs start capturing new input data on subsequent negative clock edges

scenario: Glitch Immunity
description: Apply glitches on input data between clock edges and verify outputs only update on valid negative clock edges

scenario: Power-On State
description: Verify initial state of flip-flops before first clock edge or reset assertion
