scenario: Basic Output Verification
description: Verify that the output remains at logic 0 continuously for multiple clock cycles

scenario: Power-on State
description: Check if the output initializes to 0 immediately after power-on without any transition

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: Monitor the output for an extended period (1000+ clock cycles) to ensure it maintains logic 0

scenario: Reset Behavior
description: Apply system reset and verify output remains at 0 during and after reset assertion

scenario: Clock Edge Response
description: Verify output remains stable at 0 across multiple rising and falling clock edges

scenario: Output Load Variation
description: Verify output maintains logic 0 under different output load conditions
