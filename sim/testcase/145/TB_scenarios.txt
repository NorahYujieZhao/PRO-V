scenario: Basic Pattern Detection
description: Send pattern '1101' followed by delay value '0000', verify counting starts and lasts exactly 1000 cycles with count output showing 0

scenario: Maximum Delay Count
description: Send pattern '1101' followed by delay value '1111', verify counting lasts exactly 16000 cycles with count output decreasing every 1000 cycles from 15 to 0

scenario: Partial Pattern Reset
description: Send partial pattern '110' then assert reset, verify circuit restarts pattern detection from beginning

scenario: Invalid Pattern Rejection
description: Send invalid patterns like '1100', '1111', verify circuit continues searching and doesn't start counting

scenario: Missing Acknowledgment
description: Complete a counting sequence but don't assert ack, verify done remains high and new pattern detection doesn't start

scenario: Immediate Reset During Count
description: Start counting sequence then assert reset, verify immediate return to pattern detection state

scenario: Data Input During Count
description: Send new pattern '1101' while counting is active, verify it's ignored until current sequence completes and is acknowledged

scenario: Multiple Sequential Timers
description: Run three complete timer sequences back-to-back with different delays, verify correct counting and proper acknowledgment handling between sequences

scenario: Count Output Verification
description: Verify count output updates exactly every 1000 cycles and decrements properly from delay value to 0

scenario: Signal Timing Verification
description: Verify counting and done signals assert/deassert at correct clock edges relative to pattern detection and acknowledgment
