scenario: All Zeros Input
description: Set all input vectors to zero and verify outputs have correct positioning with LSB bits set to 1

scenario: All Ones Input
description: Set all input vectors to maximum value 5'b11111 and verify correct concatenation and output splitting

scenario: Alternating Pattern
description: Set alternating inputs to all ones and zeros to verify bit boundaries are preserved during concatenation

scenario: Walking Ones
description: Apply walking ones pattern across all inputs to verify each bit position is correctly mapped to outputs

scenario: Random Values
description: Apply random valid 5bit values to all inputs to verify general functionality and concatenation

scenario: Verify LSB Bits
description: Test multiple input combinations to ensure the two LSB bits are always set to 1 regardless of inputs

scenario: Boundary Check
description: Test transition between segments by setting adjacent inputs to complementary values

scenario: Output Segment Verification
description: Verify each 8bit output segment contains the correct portion of concatenated input bits
