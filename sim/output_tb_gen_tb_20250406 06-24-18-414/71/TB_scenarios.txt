scenario: OnlyAHigh
description: Set a to 1 b c to 0 to verify isolated routing from a to w

scenario: OnlyBHigh
description: Set b to 1 a c to 0 to verify routing from b to both x and y

scenario: OnlyCHigh
description: Set c to 1 a b to 0 to verify isolated routing from c to z

scenario: AlternatingPattern1
description: Set a to 1 b to 0 c to 1 to test alternating signal patterns

scenario: AlternatingPattern2
description: Set a to 0 b to 1 c to 0 to test complementary alternating pattern

scenario: CrosstalkCheck
description: Toggle each input while others remain stable to verify no signal interference
