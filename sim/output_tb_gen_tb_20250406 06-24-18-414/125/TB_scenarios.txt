scenario: AllZeros
description: Set all 100 bits to 0 to verify basic functionality with uniform input

scenario: AllOnes
description: Set all 100 bits to 1 to check reversal behavior with maximum value input

scenario: AlternatingBits
description: Set input to alternating 1s and 0s pattern to verify correct handling of regular patterns across full width

scenario: BoundaryBitsSet
description: Set only the MSB bit99 and LSB bit0 to 1 with all others 0 to verify extreme end bit handling

scenario: LeftHalfOnes
description: Set bits 99 down to 50 to 1 and bits 49 to 0 to 0 to test half width patterns

scenario: RightHalfOnes
description: Set bits 49 down to 0 to 1 and bits 99 to 50 to 0 to verify complementary half width pattern

scenario: OneHotPattern
description: Set only single bits at positions 0 25 50 75 and 99 to verify sparse bit pattern reversal

scenario: CheckerboardPattern
description: Set groups of 4 bits alternating between 1s and 0s to test reversal of regular block patterns
