The case TestbenchStructure does not match the specification
the reasoning is The testbench is incorrectly structured, looking for 'clock cycles' which is not relevant for combinational logic
the input variable is N/A - testbench structure error
The present output is Error message about missing 'clock cycles'
The correct output is Should be pure combinational input/output pairs without clock cycle dependencies
The case CombinationalBehavior does not match the specification
the reasoning is Cannot verify combinational behavior due to missing proper testbench data
the input variable is N/A - missing proper testbench data
The present output is N/A - missing proper testbench data
The correct output is Should show immediate output response to input changes without clock dependency
