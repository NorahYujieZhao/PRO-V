scenario: Initial Power Up State
description: Verify system initializes with no sensors asserted and all flow rates active fr1 fr2 fr3 and dfr enabled

scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal while system is in various states to verify it returns to lowest water level state with all outputs active

scenario: Rising Water Level Transitions
description: Sequentially assert sensors from s1 to s3 verifying correct flow rates and supplemental flow dfr activation due to rising trend

scenario: Falling Water Level Transitions
description: Sequentially deassert sensors from s3 to s1 verifying correct flow rates and supplemental flow dfr deactivation

scenario: Maximum Water Level
description: Assert all sensors s1 s2 s3 and verify all flow rates and supplemental flow are disabled

scenario: Minimum Water Level
description: Deassert all sensors and verify maximum flow with fr1 fr2 fr3 and dfr all enabled

scenario: Invalid Sensor Combinations
description: Test nonsequential sensor patterns like only s3 active or s1 and s3 active without s2 to verify robust error handling

scenario: Rapid Sensor Changes
description: Toggle sensor values rapidly across multiple clock cycles to verify stable flow rate control and proper state transitions

scenario: Direction Change Detection
description: Alternate between rising and falling water levels to verify correct supplemental flow dfr activation based on trend
