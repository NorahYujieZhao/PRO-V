scenario: InitialStateTransition
description: Start from state A by setting y[6:1]=000001 and toggle w between 0 and 1 to verify transitions to states B and A

scenario: StateAToB
description: Set y[6:1]=000001 state A and w=0 to test transition to state B which affects Y2

scenario: StateBToDTransition
description: Set y[6:1]=000010 state B and w=1 to verify transition to state D affecting Y4

scenario: StateCToDTransition
description: Set y[6:1]=000100 state C and w=1 to check transition to state D affecting Y4

scenario: StateDToATransition
description: Set y[6:1]=001000 state D and w=1 to verify transition back to state A

scenario: StateEToDTransition
description: Set y[6:1]=010000 state E and w=1 to test transition to state D affecting Y4

scenario: StateFToDTransition
description: Set y[6:1]=100000 state F and w=1 to verify transition to state D affecting Y4

scenario: MultipleStateTransitions
description: Sequence through multiple states ABCD by setting appropriate one hot encodings and w values to verify Y2 and Y4 behavior
