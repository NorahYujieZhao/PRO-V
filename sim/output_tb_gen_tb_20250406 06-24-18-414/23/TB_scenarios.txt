scenario: SelectFirstBit
description: Set sel to 0 and in[0] to 1 with all other bits 0 to verify correct selection of the first bit

scenario: SelectLastBit
description: Set sel to 255 and in[255] to 1 with all other bits 0 to verify correct selection of the last bit

scenario: SelectMiddleBit
description: Set sel to 128 and in[128] to 1 with all other bits 0 to verify correct selection from middle of input vector

scenario: AlternatingInputPattern
description: Set input vector to alternating 1s and 0s and sweep sel through multiple values to verify selection from alternating pattern

scenario: AllOnesInput
description: Set all input bits to 1 and sweep sel through various values to verify selection works with saturated input

scenario: AllZerosInput
description: Set all input bits to 0 and sweep sel through various values to verify selection works with grounded input

scenario: OneHotInput
description: Create one hot pattern in input vector and sweep sel to verify correct bit selection from sparse input pattern

scenario: BoundaryTransition
description: Sweep sel across boundary values 0 1 254 255 while changing input bits to verify correct selection at range limits
