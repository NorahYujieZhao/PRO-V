scenario: Normal Counting Sequence
description: Verify counter increments from 1 to 10 in sequence over multiple clock cycles, then rolls over to 1

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset signal at different counter values and verify counter returns to 1 on next clock edge

scenario: Power-on State
description: Check initial counter value without reset assertion to verify proper initialization

scenario: Boundary Value Transition
description: Verify counter correctly transitions from 10 back to 1 on next clock cycle

scenario: Reset at Boundary
description: Assert reset when counter is at 10 to verify proper reset to 1 behavior

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Assert reset for multiple clock cycles and verify counter remains at 1 until reset deasserted

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: Run counter for multiple complete cycles (1-10) to verify consistent counting behavior
