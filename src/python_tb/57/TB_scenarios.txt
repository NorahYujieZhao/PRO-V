scenario: All Input Combinations
description: Test all four possible input combinations (00,01,10,11) to verify XNOR truth table: output should be 1 when both inputs match (00 or 11), and 0 when inputs differ (01 or 10)

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test all possible input transitions to verify output changes correctly when inputs change state, checking both rising and falling edge transitions

scenario: Glitch Detection
description: Apply quick input changes within small time intervals to verify output stability and absence of unwanted glitches during transitions

scenario: Signal Stability
description: Hold each input combination steady for extended periods to verify output maintains stable correct value without fluctuation

scenario: Timing Verification
description: Measure propagation delay from input change to output stabilization, ensuring it meets timing requirements for both rising and falling transitions
