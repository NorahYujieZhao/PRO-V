scenario: Basic P1Y Functionality
description: Test first 3-input AND gate by setting p1a=1, p1b=1, p1c=1 while p1d=0, p1e=0, p1f=0, verifying p1y=1. Then test second 3-input AND gate similarly.

scenario: Basic P2Y Functionality
description: Test first 2-input AND gate by setting p2a=1, p2b=1 while p2c=0, p2d=0, verifying p2y=1. Then test second 2-input AND gate similarly.

scenario: P1Y Complete Truth Table
description: Verify all 64 possible combinations (2^6) of p1a through p1f inputs to ensure correct OR-AND behavior for p1y output

scenario: P2Y Complete Truth Table
description: Verify all 16 possible combinations (2^4) of p2a through p2d inputs to ensure correct OR-AND behavior for p2y output

scenario: Simultaneous Output Changes
description: Test both p1y and p2y outputs simultaneously changing by varying all inputs together, verifying no interference between paths

scenario: Input Transition Times
description: Verify output stability when inputs change with different transition times and slight timing misalignments

scenario: Glitch Detection
description: Check for any potential glitches in outputs when multiple inputs change simultaneously or nearly simultaneously
