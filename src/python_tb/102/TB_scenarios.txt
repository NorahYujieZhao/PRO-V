scenario: All Zero Inputs
description: When x=0 and y=0, verify z=1 as shown in first 20ns of waveform

scenario: Single High Input X
description: When x=1 and y=0, verify z=0 as shown at 25-30ns of waveform

scenario: Single High Input Y
description: When x=0 and y=1, verify z=0 as shown at 35-40ns of waveform

scenario: Both Inputs High
description: When x=1 and y=1, verify z=1 as shown at 45-50ns of waveform

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Verify output z responds correctly to rapid input changes as shown in 55-90ns period

scenario: Glitch Detection
description: Monitor output z for any glitches during input transitions between stable states

scenario: Setup and Hold Times
description: Verify output z stabilizes within expected propagation delay after input changes
