scenario: Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal for multiple clock cycles and verify FSM enters state A with z=0 output

scenario: Path to Output 1
description: Test transition sequence A->B->C->E (w=1,1,1) to reach first output z=1 state

scenario: Path to Alternative Output 1
description: Test transition sequence A->B->C->D->F (w=1,1,0,1) to reach second output z=1 state

scenario: State E Self-Loop
description: Reach state E and apply w=1 multiple times to verify self-loop behavior while maintaining z=1

scenario: Return to Initial State
description: Test multiple paths back to state A: D->A(w=0), and E->D->A(w=0,0)

scenario: Output Stability
description: Verify output z maintains correct value through state transitions without glitches

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while in states E/F (z=1) and verify immediate transition to state A with z=0

scenario: Rapid Input Toggling
description: Toggle input w rapidly to stress test state transition logic and timing requirements
