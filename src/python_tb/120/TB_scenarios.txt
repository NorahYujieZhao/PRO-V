scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: Apply alternating 1s and 0s input pattern (1010) and verify data shifts through all four flip-flops correctly over 4 clock cycles

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert resetn (drive low) during shifting operation and verify all flip-flops clear to 0 on the next clock edge

scenario: Consecutive Ones
description: Input continuous 1s for 6 clock cycles and verify correct propagation through the shift register

scenario: Consecutive Zeros
description: Input continuous 0s for 6 clock cycles and verify correct propagation through the shift register

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: Release reset (drive resetn high) and immediately begin shifting data, verify proper data capture resumes

scenario: Reset During Input Change
description: Assert reset while input is changing to verify synchronous reset behavior overrides input changes

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to clock edge to verify proper setup time requirements are met

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Maintain input data stable after clock edge to verify proper hold time requirements are met
