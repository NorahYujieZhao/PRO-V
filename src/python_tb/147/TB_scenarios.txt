scenario: Normal Operation Single Byte
description: Send a complete valid byte (0x55) with correct start bit (0), data bits (01010101), and stop bit (1), verify 'done' asserts after stop bit

scenario: Multiple Consecutive Bytes
description: Send three consecutive valid bytes with proper idle periods between them, verify 'done' pulses correctly after each byte

scenario: Missing Stop Bit
description: Send byte with correct start and data bits but missing stop bit (0), verify FSM waits for next valid '1' before attempting new byte detection

scenario: Premature Stop Bit
description: Insert '1' during data bit reception, verify FSM doesn't falsely detect it as stop bit and continues normal operation

scenario: Reset During Reception
description: Assert reset while receiving data bits, verify FSM returns to idle state and waits for next start bit

scenario: Extended Idle Period
description: Maintain input high (idle) for multiple clock cycles, verify FSM remains stable and ready for next start bit

scenario: False Start Bit
description: Send isolated '0' without following data bits, verify FSM returns to idle after timeout without asserting done

scenario: Boundary Value Data
description: Test with data patterns 0x00 and 0xFF to verify correct handling of all-zeros and all-ones data bytes
