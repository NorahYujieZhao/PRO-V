scenario: Basic Water Level Above s[3]
description: Set all sensors (s[3:1]) to 1, verify all flow rates (fr3,fr2,fr1,dfr) are 0

scenario: Water Level Between s[3] and s[2]
description: Set s[2:1]=1, s[3]=0, verify fr1=1 and fr2=fr3=dfr=0

scenario: Water Level Between s[2] and s[1]
description: Set s[1]=1, s[2:3]=0, verify fr1=fr2=1 and fr3=dfr=0

scenario: Water Level Below s[1]
description: Set all sensors to 0, verify all flow rates are 1 (fr3=fr2=fr1=1)

scenario: Rising Water Level Transition
description: Transition from s[1]=1 to s[2]=1, verify dfr assertion due to rising water level

scenario: Falling Water Level Transition
description: Transition from s[2]=1 to s[1]=1, verify dfr remains 0 due to falling water level

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset while in high water level state, verify transition to lowest level state with all outputs asserted

scenario: Multiple Level Changes
description: Perform multiple sequential level changes and verify correct flow rate and dfr responses based on direction

scenario: Invalid Sensor Patterns
description: Test non-sequential sensor patterns (e.g., s[3]=1,s[2]=0,s[1]=1) to verify robust handling

scenario: Rapid Level Changes
description: Change water levels rapidly across multiple clock cycles to verify stable state transitions
