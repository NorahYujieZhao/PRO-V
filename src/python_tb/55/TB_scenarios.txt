scenario: Asynchronous Reset Verification
description: Assert areset at different times between clock edges to verify immediate transition to state B (output=1) regardless of current state

scenario: State B Self-Loop
description: While in state B, apply input=1 for multiple cycles and verify output remains 1, confirming B->B transition

scenario: State B to A Transition
description: From state B, apply input=0 and verify transition to state A (output changes from 1 to 0) on next clock edge

scenario: State A Self-Loop
description: While in state A, apply input=1 for multiple cycles and verify output remains 0, confirming A->A transition

scenario: State A to B Transition
description: From state A, apply input=0 and verify transition to state B (output changes from 0 to 1) on next clock edge

scenario: Input Toggle Test
description: Rapidly toggle input between 0 and 1 to verify correct state transitions and corresponding output changes

scenario: Reset During Transition
description: Assert reset while transitioning between states to verify immediate return to state B regardless of transition progress

scenario: Power-On State
description: Verify FSM initializes to correct state and output value without explicit reset assertion
