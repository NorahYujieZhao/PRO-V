scenario: Initial Reset Behavior
description: Apply reset signal and verify shift_ena asserts for exactly 4 clock cycles then deasserts

scenario: Multiple Reset Pulses
description: Apply multiple reset pulses with varying intervals and verify each triggers a new 4-cycle shift_ena sequence

scenario: Reset During Active Shift
description: Assert reset while shift_ena is active (cycles 1-3) and verify new 4-cycle sequence starts immediately

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: After reset deassert, monitor shift_ena for 20+ cycles to ensure it remains low without additional resets

scenario: Reset Timing Verification
description: Test reset assertion/deassertion at different clock edges to verify synchronous behavior

scenario: Glitch Immunity
description: Apply short reset pulses (less than one clock cycle) and verify FSM only responds to reset on clock edges

scenario: Power-on State
description: Verify initial state without explicit reset and confirm shift_ena remains deasserted
