scenario: Basic Heating Mode Operation
description: Set mode=1 (heating), toggle too_cold between 0 and 1, verify heater and fan activate only when too_cold=1, and aircon remains off

scenario: Basic Cooling Mode Operation
description: Set mode=0 (cooling), toggle too_hot between 0 and 1, verify aircon and fan activate only when too_hot=1, and heater remains off

scenario: Manual Fan Control
description: Set fan_on=1 with both too_hot=0 and too_cold=0, verify fan operates independently in both modes without activating heater or aircon

scenario: Mode Switching
description: Toggle mode between 0 and 1 while maintaining temperature conditions, verify proper switching between heating and cooling operations

scenario: Invalid Temperature Combinations
description: Set both too_hot=1 and too_cold=1, verify system responds according to current mode setting only

scenario: Fan Priority Check
description: Toggle fan_on while heater/aircon are active, verify fan remains on regardless of manual fan control input

scenario: Rapid Mode Switching
description: Rapidly toggle mode while temperature conditions are active, verify system responds without glitches or incorrect output combinations

scenario: All Inputs Toggling
description: Toggle all input combinations rapidly, verify no invalid output states occur (like heater and aircon on simultaneously)
