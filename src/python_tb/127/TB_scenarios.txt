scenario: Asynchronous Reset Verification
description: Assert areset during different states (shifting/loading) and verify immediate reset to 0000 regardless of clock edge

scenario: Load Operation
description: Assert load=1, ena=0 with different data patterns (0101, 1010, 1111, 0000) and verify correct loading on clock edge

scenario: Right Shift Operation
description: Set load=0, ena=1 with initial value 1111 and verify right shift operation over multiple clock cycles, checking MSB becomes 0

scenario: Priority Verification
description: Assert both load and ena (load=1, ena=1) and verify load operation takes precedence over shift operation

scenario: No Operation
description: Set load=0, ena=0 and verify register maintains its current value over multiple clock cycles

scenario: Sequential Operations
description: Perform sequence of load->shift->hold->shift operations to verify seamless transition between operations

scenario: Control Signal Timing
description: Test setup/hold timing of load and ena signals relative to clock edge for proper operation

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: Assert areset, then deassert and immediately perform load/shift operations to verify proper recovery
