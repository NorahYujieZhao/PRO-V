scenario: Basic State Transitions
description: Test normal state transitions: OFF->ON (j=1), ON->OFF (k=1), OFF->OFF (j=0), ON->ON (k=0)

scenario: Asynchronous Reset During OFF
description: Assert reset while in OFF state, verify output remains 0 and state stays OFF

scenario: Asynchronous Reset During ON
description: Assert reset while in ON state, verify immediate transition to OFF state (output=0)

scenario: Input Changes at Clock Edge
description: Change j/k inputs exactly at clock edge to verify proper synchronous behavior and setup/hold times

scenario: Simultaneous J/K Changes
description: Change both j and k inputs simultaneously to verify proper state handling and no glitches

scenario: Reset Release Timing
description: Release reset at various times relative to clock edge to verify proper state restoration

scenario: Input Glitch Immunity
description: Apply brief pulses on j/k inputs between clock edges to verify glitch immunity

scenario: Power-On State
description: Verify circuit initializes to OFF state on power-up before any reset assertion
