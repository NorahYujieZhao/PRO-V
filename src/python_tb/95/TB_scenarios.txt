scenario: Basic Selection Control
description: Test sel=0 and sel=1 with different input combinations to verify correct input selection

scenario: All Input Combinations
description: Verify all possible input combinations (a=0/1, b=0/1, sel=0/1) to ensure complete truth table coverage

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test transitions on inputs a and b while maintaining constant sel value to verify stability

scenario: Selection Transitions
description: Change sel value while keeping inputs constant to verify clean switching between inputs

scenario: Simultaneous Transitions
description: Change multiple inputs simultaneously to verify proper handling of concurrent transitions

scenario: Glitch Detection
description: Monitor output for potential glitches during input and selection transitions

scenario: Setup and Hold Times
