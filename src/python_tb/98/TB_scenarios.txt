scenario: Reset Functionality
description: Assert and deassert reset signal (resetn) to verify FSM returns to state A and outputs f=0, g=0

scenario: Initial F Pulse
description: After reset deassert, verify f=1 for exactly one clock cycle and then returns to 0

scenario: X Sequence Detection
description: Input sequence x=1,0,1 over three clock cycles and verify g activates on fourth cycle

scenario: Y Input Window Success
description: After g activation, assert y=1 within two clock cycles and verify g remains permanently high

scenario: Y Input Window Timeout
description: After g activation, keep y=0 for three clock cycles and verify g goes permanently low

scenario: Partial X Sequence
description: Test incomplete x sequences (1,0,0 and 1,1,1) to verify g remains inactive

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset during various FSM states to verify immediate return to initial state

scenario: Multiple State Cycles
description: Run multiple complete cycles of state transitions to verify consistent behavior

scenario: Invalid Y Timing
description: Assert y=1 after two-cycle window expires to verify g remains in its current state

scenario: Glitch Immunity
description: Apply single-cycle glitches on x and y inputs to verify FSM maintains correct state
