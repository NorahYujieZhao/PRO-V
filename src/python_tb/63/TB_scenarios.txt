scenario: Hold State Verification
description: Set J=0, K=0 for multiple clock cycles with different initial Q values to verify output maintains previous state

scenario: Reset Operation
description: Set J=0, K=1 across multiple clock edges to verify Q is forced to 0 regardless of previous state

scenario: Set Operation
description: Set J=1, K=0 across multiple clock edges to verify Q is forced to 1 regardless of previous state

scenario: Toggle Operation
description: Set J=1, K=1 for multiple clock cycles to verify Q toggles between 0 and 1 on each positive clock edge

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Change J,K inputs during clock cycles to verify changes only take effect on positive clock edges

scenario: Rapid Input Changes
description: Apply quick changes to J,K inputs near clock edges to verify setup/hold time requirements

scenario: Sequential State Changes
description: Apply all four input combinations in sequence to verify correct state transitions and no state corruption
