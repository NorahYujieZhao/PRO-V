scenario: Basic Data Capture
description: Apply different 8-bit data patterns (0x55, 0xAA, 0xFF, 0x00) on consecutive clock cycles and verify correct data latching on rising edge

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Assertion
description: Assert areset signal between clock edges and verify all flip-flops immediately reset to 0 regardless of clock state

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: Release reset and apply data pattern to verify normal operation resumes on next clock edge

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to clock edge and verify proper data capture with varying setup times

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input data immediately after clock edge and verify previous value is maintained

scenario: Reset During Data Change
description: Assert reset while data is changing to verify reset dominance over data input

scenario: Walking Ones Pattern
description: Apply walking ones pattern (0x01, 0x02, 0x04, etc.) to verify individual flip-flop functionality

scenario: Rapid Toggle
description: Alternate between 0x00 and 0xFF at maximum frequency to verify stability under fast switching conditions
