scenario: Normal Computer Operation
description: Test computer operation when CPU is not overheated (cpu_overheated=0), verify shut_off_computer remains 0

scenario: CPU Overheating Protection
description: Test protection mechanism when CPU overheats (cpu_overheated=1), verify shut_off_computer asserts to 1

scenario: Normal Driving Condition
description: Test driving logic when not arrived and gas tank not empty (arrived=0, gas_tank_empty=0), verify keep_driving=1

scenario: Empty Gas Tank
description: Test driving logic when gas tank is empty (gas_tank_empty=1), verify keep_driving=0 regardless of arrived status

scenario: Destination Arrived
description: Test driving logic when destination is reached (arrived=1), verify keep_driving=0 regardless of gas tank status

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test all possible input transitions to verify glitch-free output changes in combinational logic

scenario: Simultaneous Input Changes
description: Test behavior when multiple inputs change simultaneously to verify correct output priority

scenario: Default Output Values
