scenario: Basic Data Loading
description: Load different 8-bit data patterns (0x55, 0xAA, 0xFF, 0x00) on consecutive clock cycles with reset deasserted, verify correct data capture on rising edge

scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal while loading non-zero data patterns, verify all flip-flops synchronously reset to 0 on next rising clock edge

scenario: Reset Deassert Recovery
description: Deassert reset and immediately load data pattern 0xFF, verify flip-flops properly capture new data on next clock edge

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to clock rising edge, verify proper data capture within setup time requirements

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input data just after clock rising edge, verify previous data maintains stability through hold time window

scenario: Alternating Bits Pattern
description: Toggle between 0x55 and 0xAA patterns to stress adjacent flip-flops with opposite values

scenario: Reset During Data Change
description: Assert reset while data is changing between patterns, verify synchronous reset behavior overrides data input

scenario: Walking Ones Pattern
description: Shift single '1' bit across all positions (0x01, 0x02, 0x04, etc.) to verify individual flip-flop functionality
