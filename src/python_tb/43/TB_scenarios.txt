scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: Shift in 8 bits (pattern 10101010) with enable=1, verify each bit appears at correct position Q[7:0] after 8 clock cycles

scenario: Disabled Shift Operation
description: Apply input changes with enable=0, verify shift register maintains its previous state without shifting

scenario: Random Access Read
description: Load pattern 11001100, test all address combinations (ABC=000 to 111) to verify correct bit selection through multiplexer

scenario: Address Transition
description: Change ABC inputs rapidly while maintaining stable shift register content, verify output Z changes combinationally

scenario: Simultaneous Shift and Read
description: Perform shift operation while changing ABC values, verify correct data appears at Z based on updated shift register contents

scenario: Enable Toggle
description: Toggle enable signal between shifts, verify partial pattern loading and holding behavior

scenario: Setup and Hold Time
description: Verify data (S) and enable signal meet setup/hold requirements relative to clock edge for reliable shifting

scenario: Power-on State
description: Check initial state of shift register outputs and Z before any shifting occurs
