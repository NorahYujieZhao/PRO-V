scenario: Reset Verification
description: Assert resetn (active-low) and verify FSM enters state A with all grants (g) set to 0

scenario: No Requests
description: Set all requests (r) to 0 and verify FSM remains in state A with all grants (g) at 0

scenario: Single Request Priority
description: Assert each request (r1, r2, r3) individually to verify correct grant assignment and state transitions

scenario: Multiple Request Priority
description: Assert multiple requests simultaneously (r1=r2=1, r1=r3=1, r2=r3=1, r1=r2=r3=1) to verify priority enforcement

scenario: Grant Persistence
description: After granting access, maintain request high and verify grant remains active until request deasserted

scenario: State A to B Transition
description: Set r1=1 from state A and verify transition to state B with g1=1

scenario: State A to C Transition
description: Set r2=1 (with r1=0) from state A and verify transition to state C with g2=1

scenario: Return to State A
description: From states B and C, deassert respective requests and verify return to state A with all grants cleared

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert resetn while in states B or C and verify immediate return to state A with all grants cleared

scenario: Request Change During Grant
description: While in grant states (B or C), change other request inputs and verify grant persistence
