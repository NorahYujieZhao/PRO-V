scenario: Basic Sequence Detection
description: Input the exact sequence '1101' and verify start_shifting asserts and stays high after detection

scenario: Overlapping Sequence
description: Test input stream '11011101' containing overlapping target patterns to verify continuous detection behavior

scenario: Partial Match Reset
description: Input partial sequence '110' followed by reset, verify FSM returns to initial state without asserting output

scenario: Post-Detection Reset
description: After sequence detection and output assertion, apply reset and verify start_shifting returns to 0

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Apply multiple reset pulses between and during sequence detection to verify robust reset behavior

scenario: False Pattern Testing
description: Input similar but incorrect sequences like '1100', '1111', '0110' to verify FSM doesn't falsely detect pattern

scenario: Continuous Operation
description: After pattern detection, continue inputting random bits to verify start_shifting remains asserted until reset

scenario: Quick Transition Testing
description: Input sequence with minimum clock cycles between transitions to verify timing requirements are met
