scenario: InitialZeroInput
description: 12 clock cycles. Input a is held at 0 to verify q transitions to and maintains 1 after the first rising edge

scenario: InitialOneInput
description: 12 clock cycles. Input a is held at 1 to verify q transitions to and maintains 0 after the first rising edge

scenario: ZeroToOneTransition
description: 16 clock cycles. Input a starts at 0 for 8 cycles then changes to 1 to verify q changes from 1 to 0 at the transition

scenario: OneToZeroTransition
description: 16 clock cycles. Input a starts at 1 for 8 cycles then changes to 0 to verify q changes from 0 to 1 at the transition

scenario: AlternatingPattern
description: 20 clock cycles. Input a alternates between 0 and 1 every 4 clock cycles to verify correct toggling behavior of q
