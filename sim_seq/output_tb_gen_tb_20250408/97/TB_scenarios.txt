scenario: Synchronous Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal for one clock cycle and verify FSM enters state 000

scenario: State Transition with Input X Zero
description: Starting from each valid state verify next state transitions when x is 0 according to state table

scenario: State Transition with Input X One
description: Starting from each valid state verify next state transitions when x is 1 according to state table

scenario: Output Z Generation
description: Verify output z is 1 only in states 011 and 100 and 0 in all other states

scenario: Multiple State Transitions
description: Create sequence of x inputs to traverse through multiple states and verify correct state sequence

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while FSM is in various states and verify return to state 000

scenario: Rapid Input Changes
description: Toggle input x rapidly and verify FSM follows correct state transitions at clock edges only

scenario: Setup and Hold Time
description: Verify FSM captures input x correctly with respect to clock edge timing requirements
