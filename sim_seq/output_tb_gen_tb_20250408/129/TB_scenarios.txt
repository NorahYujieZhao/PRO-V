scenario: Normal Data Capture
description: Apply different 8 bit data patterns and verify correct capture on positive clock edges

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Assertion
description: Assert reset signal between clock edges and verify all outputs immediately go to 0

scenario: Reset Release Operation
description: Release reset and verify DFFs start capturing new input data on subsequent clock edges

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to clock edge to verify proper setup time requirements are met

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input data just after clock edge to verify proper hold time requirements are met

scenario: Alternating Bit Patterns
description: Apply alternating 1s and 0s pattern to verify no crosstalk between adjacent DFF bits

scenario: Walking Ones Pattern
description: Apply single 1 bit shifting through all positions to verify individual bit functionality

scenario: Reset During Data Change
description: Assert reset while data is changing to verify reset dominance over data inputs
