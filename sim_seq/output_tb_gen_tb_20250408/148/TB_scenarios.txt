scenario: Normal Byte Reception
description: Send a complete valid byte with start bit 0 eight data bits and stop bit 1 verify correct data capture and done signal assertion

scenario: Multiple Consecutive Bytes
description: Transmit multiple valid bytes back to back verify each byte is captured correctly with proper done signal timing

scenario: Missing Stop Bit
description: Send byte with incorrect stop bit 0 instead of 1 verify FSM waits for next valid stop bit before attempting new byte reception

scenario: Idle Line Recovery
description: After error condition verify FSM recovers and can receive next valid byte when line returns to idle state 1

scenario: Reset During Reception
description: Assert reset during middle of byte reception verify FSM returns to idle state and discards partial data

scenario: LSB First Verification
description: Send byte with alternating bit pattern verify LSB is received first and byte is reconstructed in correct order

scenario: Maximum Value Byte
description: Transmit byte with all 1s verify correct capture of 0xFF value and proper done signal assertion

scenario: Minimum Value Byte
description: Transmit byte with all 0s verify correct capture of 0x00 value and proper done signal assertion

scenario: Glitch During Reception
description: Introduce brief glitch during data bits verify FSM maintains correct bit counting and data capture
