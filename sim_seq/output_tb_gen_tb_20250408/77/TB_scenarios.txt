scenario: Single Bit Rising Edge
description: Test individual bits transitioning from 0 to 1 while other bits remain stable to verify correct edge detection for isolated changes

scenario: Single Bit Falling Edge
description: Test individual bits transitioning from 1 to 0 while other bits remain stable to verify correct edge detection for isolated changes

scenario: Multiple Simultaneous Edges
description: Change multiple bits simultaneously in both rising and falling transitions to verify correct detection of concurrent edges

scenario: Consecutive Transitions
description: Apply back to back transitions on same bits across multiple clock cycles to verify edge detection works continuously

scenario: Alternating Bit Patterns
description: Toggle between different bit patterns every clock cycle to verify edge detection across all bits

scenario: Stable Input
description: Maintain stable input values for multiple clock cycles to verify no false edge detections occur

scenario: Walking Ones Pattern
description: Shift a single 1 across all bit positions to verify edge detection works for each bit position

scenario: Walking Zeros Pattern
description: Shift a single 0 across all bit positions to verify edge detection works for each bit position
