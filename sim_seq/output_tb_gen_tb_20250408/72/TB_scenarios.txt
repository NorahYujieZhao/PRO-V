scenario: Normal Data Capture
description: Apply different data values at D input and verify Q output changes on positive clock edges when data is stable

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Assertion
description: Assert asynchronous reset ar at different times between clock edges and verify Q immediately goes to 0

scenario: Reset Release Operation
description: Release asynchronous reset and verify Q captures next D value on subsequent positive clock edge

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change D input at varying times before positive clock edge to verify proper setup time requirements

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change D input at varying times after positive clock edge to verify proper hold time requirements

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify Q only updates on positive clock edges and remains stable on negative edges

scenario: Reset During Clock Edge
description: Assert reset simultaneously with clock edge to verify reset has priority over clock triggered operation
