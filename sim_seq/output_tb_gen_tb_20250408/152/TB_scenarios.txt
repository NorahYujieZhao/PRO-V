scenario: Initial State Loading
description: Assert load signal and verify data is correctly loaded into q register on the next clock edge

scenario: Single Cell Evolution
description: Load a single live cell and verify it dies due to underpopulation rule 0-1 neighbors

scenario: Stable Pattern
description: Load a 2x2 block pattern and verify it remains unchanged due to 2 neighbor rule

scenario: Cell Birth
description: Load a pattern where dead cells have exactly 3 neighbors and verify they become alive

scenario: Overpopulation
description: Load dense patterns where cells have 4 or more neighbors and verify they die

scenario: Toroidal Edge Wrapping
description: Test patterns at grid edges and corners to verify correct neighbor counting across wrapped boundaries

scenario: Oscillator Pattern
description: Load a blinker pattern and verify it oscillates between horizontal and vertical states

scenario: All Cells Dead
description: Load all zeros and verify state remains unchanged after multiple clock cycles

scenario: All Cells Alive
description: Load all ones and verify cells die due to overpopulation except potential survivors

scenario: Multiple Generation Evolution
description: Track complex pattern evolution over multiple clock cycles verifying correct state transitions
