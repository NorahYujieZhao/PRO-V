scenario: Normal Counting Sequence
description: Verify counter increments correctly from 0 to 9 over multiple clock cycles with reset deasserted

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Verify counter rolls over from 9 to 0 on the next clock cycle

scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal during counting and verify counter resets to 0 on the next clock edge

scenario: Reset at Maximum Value
description: Assert reset when counter is at 9 and verify it resets to 0 on next clock edge

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Assert and deassert reset multiple times during counting to verify consistent reset behavior

scenario: Initial Power Up State
description: Verify counter starts at a known state 0 after power up before first clock edge

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify counter only changes state on rising edge of clock signal

scenario: Extended Operation
description: Run counter through multiple complete 0 to 9 sequences to verify sustained correct operation
