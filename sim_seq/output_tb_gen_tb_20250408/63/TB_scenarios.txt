scenario: Hold State Operation
description: Set J=0 K=0 and verify Q maintains previous value Qold across multiple clock cycles for both Q=1 and Q=0 initial states

scenario: Reset Operation
description: Set J=0 K=1 and verify Q transitions to 0 on next clock edge regardless of previous state

scenario: Set Operation
description: Set J=1 K=0 and verify Q transitions to 1 on next clock edge regardless of previous state

scenario: Toggle Operation
description: Set J=1 K=1 and verify Q toggles to opposite value on each clock edge starting from both Q=0 and Q=1 states

scenario: Input Changes Between Clock Edges
description: Change J K inputs between clock edges and verify Q only updates on positive clock edges

scenario: Rapid Input Transitions
description: Apply quick changes to J K inputs and verify flip flop only responds to input values present at clock edge

scenario: All State Transitions
description: Verify all possible state transitions by cycling through all JK input combinations from both Q=0 and Q=1 states
