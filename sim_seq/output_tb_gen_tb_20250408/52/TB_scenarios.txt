scenario: Basic Counting Operation
description: Assert slowena high and verify counter increments from 0 to 9 sequentially over multiple clock cycles

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Verify counter correctly rolls over from 9 back to 0 while slowena is high

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset during counting operation and verify counter synchronously resets to 0 on next clock edge

scenario: Disable Counter
description: Set slowena low during counting and verify counter maintains current value without incrementing

scenario: Enable After Pause
description: Toggle slowena from low to high and verify counter resumes incrementing from last value

scenario: Reset While Disabled
description: Assert reset while slowena is low and verify counter still resets to 0 synchronously

scenario: Simultaneous Reset and Enable
description: Assert both reset and slowena high and verify reset takes precedence setting counter to 0

scenario: Multiple Counter Cycles
description: Run counter through multiple complete 0 to 9 cycles to verify consistent operation
