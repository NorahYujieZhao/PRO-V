scenario: Initial Load Operation
description: Assert load signal and verify data input is correctly loaded into all 512 cells of q register in a single clock cycle

scenario: Boundary Cell Evolution
description: Test cells at positions 0 and 511 to verify they correctly use zero as their boundary neighbor value for next state computation

scenario: Alternating Pattern Evolution
description: Load alternating 1s and 0s pattern and verify the next state follows Rule 90 evolution rules over multiple clock cycles

scenario: Single Cell Propagation
description: Initialize with a single 1 surrounded by 0s and verify the pattern spreads according to Rule 90 dynamics over multiple cycles

scenario: All Ones Pattern
description: Load all cells with 1s and verify the next state computation produces correct pattern according to Rule 90 rules

scenario: All Zeros Pattern
description: Load all cells with 0s and verify the pattern remains stable as per Rule 90 evolution rules

scenario: Random Pattern Evolution
description: Load random bit pattern and verify multiple cycles of evolution follow Rule 90 next state computation rules

scenario: Load During Evolution
description: Assert load signal during pattern evolution to verify system correctly switches to loading new pattern
