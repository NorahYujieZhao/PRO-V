scenario: Basic Data Capture
description: Apply different input data values and verify correct capture on negative clock edge when reset is inactive

scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal and verify all flip flops synchronously reset to 0x34 on next negative clock edge

scenario: Data Change During Reset
description: Change input data while reset is active and verify outputs remain at 0x34 regardless of input changes

scenario: Reset Deactivation
description: Deactivate reset and verify flip flops resume normal operation by capturing input data on next negative clock edge

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Verify data is properly captured when changed just before the negative clock edge meeting setup time requirements

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Verify data is properly captured when held stable just after the negative clock edge meeting hold time requirements

scenario: Input Boundary Values
description: Test with input values 0x00 and 0xFF to verify proper handling of minimum and maximum 8bit values
