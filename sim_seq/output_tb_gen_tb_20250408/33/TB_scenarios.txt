scenario: Basic Data Capture
description: Apply different data values and verify correct capture on positive clock edges for all 8 bits

scenario: Alternating Bit Patterns
description: Toggle between 0x55 and 0xAA to verify all flip flops can toggle between 0 and 1 correctly

scenario: Walking Ones Pattern
description: Shift a single 1 through all bit positions to verify each DFF operates independently

scenario: Walking Zeros Pattern
description: Shift a single 0 through all 1s to verify each DFF operates independently

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to but meeting minimum setup time before clock edge to verify stable operation

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input data close to but meeting minimum hold time after clock edge to verify stable operation

scenario: Multiple Clock Cycles Stability
description: Maintain constant input data over multiple clock cycles to verify output stability

scenario: High Frequency Operation
description: Test at maximum specified clock frequency to verify proper timing and data capture
