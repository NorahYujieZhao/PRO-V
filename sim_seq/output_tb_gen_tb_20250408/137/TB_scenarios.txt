scenario: Initial Reset State
description: Apply reset and verify the machine enters state B with output 1

scenario: State B to A Transition
description: From state B input 0 should cause transition to state A with output changing to 0

scenario: State B Self Loop
description: From state B input 1 should maintain state B with output remaining 1

scenario: State A to B Transition
description: From state A input 0 should cause transition to state B with output changing to 1

scenario: State A Self Loop
description: From state A input 1 should maintain state A with output remaining 0

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while in state A to verify synchronous return to state B

scenario: Multiple State Transitions
description: Verify sequence of multiple state transitions with varying input patterns

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify state transitions and output changes occur only on rising clock edges
