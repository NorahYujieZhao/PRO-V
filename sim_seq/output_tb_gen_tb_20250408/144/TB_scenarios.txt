scenario: Basic Flag Detection
description: Send pattern 01111110 and verify flag output asserts for one clock cycle after pattern completion

scenario: Zero Bit Discard
description: Send pattern 0111110 and verify disc output asserts for one clock cycle after pattern completion

scenario: Error Detection
description: Send pattern 01111111 and verify err output asserts for one clock cycle after seeing seven consecutive 1s

scenario: Reset Behavior
description: Assert reset and verify FSM behaves as if previous input was 0 on next cycle

scenario: Multiple Consecutive Flags
description: Send multiple back to back flag patterns 01111110 01111110 and verify correct flag assertion timing

scenario: Partial Pattern Recovery
description: Send partial pattern 011111 followed by 0 and verify FSM recovers without triggering outputs

scenario: Extended Error State
description: Send eight or more consecutive 1s and verify err remains asserted for only one cycle

scenario: Reset During Pattern
description: Assert reset midway through a flag pattern and verify FSM restarts pattern detection properly

scenario: Alternating Bits
description: Send alternating 1s and 0s to verify FSM does not falsely detect patterns

scenario: Back to Back Special Patterns
description: Send discard pattern immediately followed by flag pattern and verify correct output sequencing
