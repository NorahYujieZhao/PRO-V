scenario: Basic Branch Prediction
description: Verify basic prediction functionality by requesting predictions for different PC values and checking predicted outcomes against the PHT state

scenario: Branch History Update
description: Validate that branch history register updates correctly after each prediction based on predicted direction

scenario: Basic Training Operation
description: Test training mechanism by training a specific branch pattern and verifying PHT counter updates appropriately

scenario: Saturating Counter Behavior
description: Verify 2bit saturating counter behavior by repeatedly training same branch pattern in same direction

scenario: Misprediction Recovery
description: Test branch history recovery when misprediction occurs by verifying correct restoration of history register

scenario: Concurrent Predict and Train
description: Verify simultaneous prediction and training operations where training takes precedence over prediction

scenario: PHT Entry Collision
description: Test prediction accuracy when different branches hash to same PHT entry

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Verify reset initializes PHT entries and branch history register to zero regardless of clock state

scenario: Index Hashing Verification
description: Test correct XOR hashing between PC and history bits for PHT index generation

scenario: PHT Read Before Write
description: Verify that prediction reads PHT state before training updates when accessing same entry in same cycle
