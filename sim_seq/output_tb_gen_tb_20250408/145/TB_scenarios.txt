scenario: Basic Pattern Detection
description: Input pattern 1101 followed by delay bits 0000, verify counting starts and lasts for exactly 1000 clock cycles

scenario: Maximum Delay Count
description: Input pattern 1101 followed by delay bits 1111, verify counting lasts for exactly 16000 clock cycles

scenario: Partial Pattern Reset
description: Send partial pattern 110 then assert reset, verify system restarts pattern detection from beginning

scenario: Multiple Pattern Occurrences
description: Send multiple 1101 patterns within the data stream, verify only first complete pattern triggers counting

scenario: Count Output Verification
description: For delay value 0011, verify count output shows 3 for 1000 cycles then 2 for 1000 cycles then 1 for 1000 cycles then 0 for 1000 cycles

scenario: Acknowledgment Handling
description: After counting completes verify done signal asserts and stays high until ack is received

scenario: Post Acknowledgment Behavior
description: After receiving ack verify system correctly restarts pattern detection for next 1101 sequence

scenario: Input During Counting
description: Send various input patterns during counting phase verify they are ignored until next detection phase

scenario: Reset During Counting
description: Assert reset while counting verify system immediately returns to pattern detection state

scenario: Reset During Done State
description: Assert reset while in done state waiting for ack verify system immediately returns to pattern detection state
