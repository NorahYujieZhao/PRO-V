scenario: Initial Reset State
description: Assert resetn low and verify FSM stays in state A with outputs f and g both low

scenario: Single F Pulse After Reset Release
description: Deassert resetn and verify output f becomes high for exactly one clock cycle then returns low

scenario: X Input Pattern Detection
description: Apply x input sequence 1 0 1 across three clock cycles and verify g becomes high on the following cycle

scenario: Y Input Quick Response
description: After g becomes high apply y1 within two clock cycles and verify g remains high permanently

scenario: Y Input Timeout
description: After g becomes high wait two clock cycles without y1 and verify g goes low permanently

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert resetn during various FSM states and verify immediate return to initial state with outputs low

scenario: Incomplete X Pattern
description: Send partial x input patterns like 1 0 0 or 1 1 1 and verify g remains low

scenario: Multiple X Patterns
description: Send multiple valid x patterns consecutively and verify FSM responds only to first complete pattern

scenario: Y Input Edge Timing
description: Test y input at exactly one and two cycles after g activation to verify timing window
