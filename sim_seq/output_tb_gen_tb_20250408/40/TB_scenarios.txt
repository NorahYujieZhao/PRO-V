scenario: Normal Branch Prediction
description: Assert predict_valid and alternate predict_taken values over multiple cycles to verify correct shift register operation and history updates from LSB

scenario: Branch Misprediction Recovery
description: Assert train_mispredicted and verify the history register loads correctly with concatenated train_history and train_taken values

scenario: Prediction During Misprediction
description: Assert both predict_valid and train_mispredicted simultaneously to verify misprediction takes precedence over prediction

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert areset at various times between clock edges to verify immediate reset of history register to zero

scenario: Consecutive Predictions
description: Make multiple consecutive branch predictions to verify correct shifting and maintenance of 32bit history pattern

scenario: Consecutive Mispredictions
description: Signal multiple consecutive mispredictions with different train_history and train_taken values to verify correct history recovery

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: After reset verify normal prediction and misprediction operations resume correctly with zero history

scenario: Long Run Pattern
description: Create a long sequence of predictions followed by a misprediction to verify both history building and recovery with full register utilization
