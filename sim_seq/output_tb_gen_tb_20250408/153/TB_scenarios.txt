scenario: Basic Walking Direction Change
description: Verify Lemming changes direction when bumped - start walking left, assert bump_left, verify walks right, then assert bump_right, verify walks left

scenario: Falling Behavior
description: While walking, remove ground signal and verify aaah output asserts, then restore ground and verify Lemming resumes walking in original direction

scenario: Digging Operation
description: Assert dig while walking on ground, verify digging output, remove ground to simulate breaking through, verify falling behavior then resume walking

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Assert areset at various points during operation and verify immediate transition to walking left state

scenario: Precedence Rules
description: Assert multiple conditions simultaneously to verify fall has precedence over dig, and dig has precedence over direction changes

scenario: Bump While Falling
description: Assert bump signals while falling and verify they have no effect on walking direction when ground is restored

scenario: Bump While Digging
description: Assert bump signals while digging and verify they have no effect on the walking direction when digging completes

scenario: Simultaneous Bumps
description: Assert both bump_left and bump_right simultaneously and verify direction changes correctly

scenario: Dig While Falling
description: Assert dig signal while falling and verify it is ignored until ground is restored

scenario: Ground Edge Transitions
description: Test transitions when ground disappears same cycle as bump occurs and when ground reappears while falling
