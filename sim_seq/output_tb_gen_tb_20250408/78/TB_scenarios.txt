scenario: Normal Counting Sequence
description: Verify counter increments correctly from 1 through 10 over multiple clock cycles without reset

scenario: Reset to One
description: Assert reset signal high and verify counter resets to 1 on the next clock edge regardless of current count value

scenario: Upper Boundary Transition
description: Verify counter correctly transitions from 10 back to 1 on the next clock cycle without requiring reset

scenario: Multiple Counting Cycles
description: Run counter through multiple complete 1 to 10 sequences to verify consistent behavior across cycles

scenario: Reset During Count
description: Assert reset at various count values and verify immediate synchronous reset to 1 on next clock edge

scenario: Initial Power Up State
description: Verify counter starts at 1 after initial power up with first clock edge

scenario: Reset Pulse Width
description: Test reset functionality with both single cycle and multiple cycle reset pulse widths
