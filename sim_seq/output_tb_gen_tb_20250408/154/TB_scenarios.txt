scenario: Basic Time Increment
description: Assert ena for multiple clock cycles to verify normal increment of seconds from 00 to 59

scenario: Minutes Rollover
description: Verify seconds rolling over from 59 to 00 causes minutes to increment correctly

scenario: Hours Rollover
description: Verify minutes rolling over from 59 to 00 causes hours to increment correctly

scenario: AMPM Transition
description: Verify PM flag toggles when time transitions from 11:59:59 AM to 12:00:00 PM and vice versa

scenario: Hour Format Check
description: Verify hours always stay within 01 to 12 range and use proper BCD format

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset during normal counting and verify immediate return to 12:00:00 AM

scenario: Reset Priority
description: Assert both reset and enable to verify reset takes priority over enable signal

scenario: Enable Control
description: Toggle enable signal to verify counting only occurs when enable is high

scenario: BCD Format Validation
description: Verify all digits maintain valid BCD format 0-9 during transitions

scenario: Full Day Cycle
description: Run through complete 24 hour cycle to verify all transitions and AM PM indicators
