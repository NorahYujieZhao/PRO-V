scenario: Increment Until Saturation
description: Set train_valid=1 and train_taken=1 continuously to verify counter increments from 1 to maximum value 3 and saturates

scenario: Decrement Until Saturation
description: Set train_valid=1 and train_taken=0 continuously to verify counter decrements from initial value to minimum value 0 and saturates

scenario: Hold Value When Not Training
description: Set train_valid=0 and toggle train_taken to verify counter maintains its current value

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert areset at various times between clock edges to verify counter immediately resets to 01 weakly not taken state

scenario: Increment Decrement Sequence
description: Alternate between increment and decrement operations to verify counter transitions correctly between values

scenario: Maximum Value Saturation
description: Attempt to increment counter when already at maximum value 3 to verify saturation behavior

scenario: Minimum Value Saturation
description: Attempt to decrement counter when already at minimum value 0 to verify saturation behavior

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while counter is performing increment or decrement operations to verify proper reset behavior
