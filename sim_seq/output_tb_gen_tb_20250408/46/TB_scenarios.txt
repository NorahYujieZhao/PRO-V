scenario: Synchronous Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal for one clock cycle and verify the output q is initialized to 32h1

scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: After reset deasserted verify the LFSR shifts correctly based on tap positions 32 22 2 and 1 for multiple clock cycles

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Assert and deassert reset multiple times during operation to verify proper resynchronization to 32h1 value

scenario: Tap Position Verification
description: Monitor specific bit positions 32 22 2 and 1 to verify correct XOR feedback implementation over several cycles

scenario: Full Sequence Generation
description: Run LFSR for extended period to verify it generates expected sequence length before repetition

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify LFSR only updates on positive clock edges and maintains stable output between clock edges

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while LFSR is running with non default value and verify immediate synchronous return to 32h1

scenario: Maximum Sequence Length
description: Run LFSR through complete cycle to verify it generates maximum length sequence before repeating
