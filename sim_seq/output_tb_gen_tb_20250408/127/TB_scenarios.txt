scenario: Basic Right Shift Operation
description: Assert ena high while load is low and verify data shifts right with zero filling from MSB for multiple clock cycles

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Behavior
description: Assert areset at various times between clock edges and verify immediate reset of all bits to zero regardless of current state

scenario: Load Operation
description: Assert load signal high and verify input data is correctly loaded into register on next clock edge

scenario: Load Priority Over Enable
description: Assert both load and ena signals high simultaneously and verify load operation takes precedence over shift operation

scenario: Disable State Hold
description: Set both load and ena low and verify register maintains its current value across multiple clock cycles

scenario: Sequential Operations
description: Perform sequence of load followed by multiple shift operations to verify complete functionality chain

scenario: Boundary Value Loading
description: Load boundary values 0x0 and 0xF and verify correct loading and subsequent shift operations

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: Assert reset then verify proper resumption of normal operations after reset is deasserted
