scenario: Initialize State Register
description: Apply reset condition by setting a=1 on first clock edge to initialize state register to known value

scenario: State Zero Behavior
description: When state=0 verify q output changes based on input combinations of a and b including 00->0 01->1 10->1 11->0

scenario: State One Behavior
description: When state=1 verify q output changes based on input combinations of a and b including 00->1 01->0 10->0 11->1

scenario: State Transition Zero to One
description: Verify state transitions from 0 to 1 occur correctly when specific input sequences are applied

scenario: State Transition One to Zero
description: Verify state transitions from 1 to 0 occur correctly when specific input sequences are applied

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify output and state only change on rising clock edges and remain stable between clock edges

scenario: Input Change Timing
description: Test input changes near clock edges to verify proper setup and hold time behavior

scenario: Extended Operation
description: Run multiple state transitions in sequence to verify stable longterm operation and state maintenance
