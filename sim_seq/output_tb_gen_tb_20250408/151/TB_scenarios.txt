scenario: Basic Pattern Detection
description: Input the pattern 1101 and verify the state machine correctly detects it and transitions to shift enable state

scenario: Shift Enable Duration
description: After pattern detection verify shift enable remains active for exactly 4 clock cycles then transitions to counting state

scenario: Counting State Operation
description: Verify counting output remains asserted while waiting for done counting signal and deasserts when done counting is received

scenario: Timer Completion
description: Verify done signal asserts after done counting is received and remains asserted until ack is received

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset during various states and verify FSM returns to initial pattern detection state

scenario: Partial Pattern Reset
description: Send partial pattern 110 then assert reset to verify FSM properly restarts pattern detection

scenario: Pattern Overlap
description: Send overlapping patterns like 11011101 to verify FSM only triggers on complete non overlapping patterns

scenario: Quick Acknowledgment
description: Assert ack immediately after done signal to verify rapid transition back to pattern detection

scenario: Delayed Acknowledgment
description: Wait multiple cycles before asserting ack to verify FSM remains in done state

scenario: Invalid Pattern Recovery
description: Send invalid patterns like 1100 1111 and verify FSM continues searching for valid pattern
