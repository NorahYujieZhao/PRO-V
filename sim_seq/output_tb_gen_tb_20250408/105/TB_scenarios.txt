scenario: Single Bit Transition
description: Test 0 to 1 transition on a single bit while keeping other bits constant to verify independent edge detection

scenario: Multiple Simultaneous Transitions
description: Change multiple bits from 0 to 1 in the same clock cycle to verify parallel edge detection capability

scenario: Sequential Transitions
description: Create consecutive 0 to 1 transitions on different bits across multiple clock cycles

scenario: No Change Detection
description: Maintain constant 1 or 0 values to verify no false edge detection occurs when input is stable

scenario: One Cycle Pulse Detection
description: Generate 0 to 1 to 0 transitions within consecutive clock cycles to verify single cycle edge detection

scenario: All Bits Transition
description: Transition all bits from 0x00 to 0xFF to verify correct edge detection across entire vector

scenario: Alternating Pattern
description: Apply alternating bit patterns to verify edge detection with complex switching patterns

scenario: Back to Back Transitions
description: Test consecutive 0 to 1 transitions on same bit to verify detection reset behavior
