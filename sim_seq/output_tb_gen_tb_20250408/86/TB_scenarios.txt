scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: Shift in a sequence of bits through data input with shift_ena high and count_ena low verifying MSB first operation over multiple clock cycles

scenario: Basic Down Count Operation
description: Load a value via shift operation then enable count_ena and verify the value decrements correctly on each clock cycle

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Set register to 0000 via shift operations then enable counting to verify rollover from 0000 to 1111

scenario: Shift Register Boundary
description: Shift in alternating 1s and 0s to verify all bits can hold both values and shift correctly

scenario: Counter Maximum Value
description: Load 1111 via shift operations then verify proper decrement sequence from maximum value

scenario: Mode Switching
description: Alternate between shift_ena and count_ena modes verifying proper operation when switching between modes

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify all operations shift and count occur only on the rising edge of the clock

scenario: Initial State
description: Verify the register powers up or initializes to a known state before any operations
