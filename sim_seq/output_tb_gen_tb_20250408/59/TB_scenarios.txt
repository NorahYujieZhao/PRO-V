scenario: Basic Load Operation
description: Load random 100 bit data pattern with load1 ena00 and verify q matches input data on next clock edge

scenario: Right Rotation Operation
description: Assert ena01 after loading known pattern and verify LSB rotates to MSB position while other bits shift right by one position

scenario: Left Rotation Operation
description: Assert ena10 after loading known pattern and verify MSB rotates to LSB position while other bits shift left by one position

scenario: Multiple Right Rotations
description: Perform consecutive right rotations over multiple cycles and verify pattern returns to original state after 100 rotations

scenario: Multiple Left Rotations
description: Perform consecutive left rotations over multiple cycles and verify pattern returns to original state after 100 rotations

scenario: Hold Current Value
description: Assert ena00 and ena11 and verify register maintains current value without rotation

scenario: Load During Rotation
description: Assert load while rotation is in progress and verify new data loads correctly overriding rotation operation

scenario: Alternating Direction
description: Alternate between left and right rotations and verify correct bit movement in both directions

scenario: All Ones Pattern
description: Load all ones pattern and verify rotation operations preserve all bits without corruption

scenario: All Zeros Pattern
description: Load all zeros pattern and verify rotation operations preserve all bits without corruption

scenario: Walking One Pattern
description: Load and rotate a single bit through all positions verifying precise bit movement and preservation
