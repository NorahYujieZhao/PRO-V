scenario: State Transition x0
description: Verify state transitions when x=0 for all valid present states 000 001 010 011 100 ensuring next state matches specification

scenario: State Transition x1
description: Verify state transitions when x=1 for all valid present states 000 001 010 011 100 ensuring next state matches specification

scenario: Output z Verification
description: Verify output z is 1 only for states 011 and 100 and 0 for all other states regardless of input x

scenario: Y0 Output
description: Verify Y0 output bit matches LSB of next state based on current state and x input combinations

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify state transitions occur only on positive clock edges and outputs remain stable between clock edges

scenario: Invalid States
description: Test behavior when y inputs are set to invalid states 101 110 111 to verify system response

scenario: Rapid Input Changes
description: Verify correct operation when x input changes rapidly between clock edges ensuring glitch free operation

scenario: State Sequence
description: Verify longer sequences of state transitions through multiple clock cycles match expected patterns
