scenario: Reset State Verification
description: Assert reset and verify all flow rate outputs fr1 fr2 fr3 and dfr are set to 1 indicating maximum flow rate for low water level condition

scenario: Water Level Above Highest Sensor
description: Set s3 s2 s1 to 111 and verify all flow outputs fr1 fr2 fr3 dfr are 0 indicating no flow needed

scenario: Water Level Between S3 and S2
description: Set s3 s2 s1 to 011 and verify only fr1 is active while fr2 fr3 are inactive

scenario: Water Level Between S2 and S1
description: Set s3 s2 s1 to 001 and verify fr1 and fr2 are active while fr3 is inactive

scenario: Water Level Below S1
description: Set s3 s2 s1 to 000 and verify all flow outputs fr1 fr2 fr3 are active

scenario: Rising Water Level Transition
description: Change sensors from 000 to 001 to verify supplemental flow dfr is activated when water level rises

scenario: Falling Water Level Transition
description: Change sensors from 111 to 011 to verify dfr remains inactive when water level falls

scenario: Multiple Level Changes
description: Sequence through multiple water level changes to verify proper flow rate adjustments and dfr control

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while system is operating at different water levels to verify return to maximum flow state
