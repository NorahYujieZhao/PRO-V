scenario: Basic Message Reception
description: Send a valid 3 byte message with in[3]=1 in first byte and verify done signal asserts after third byte

scenario: Multiple Sequential Messages
description: Send multiple consecutive valid 3 byte messages and verify done signal pulses correctly after each message

scenario: Invalid Start Byte Handling
description: Send bytes with in[3]=0 and verify FSM discards them until finding a valid start byte with in[3]=1

scenario: Reset During Message
description: Assert reset while receiving a message and verify FSM returns to initial state waiting for start byte

scenario: Mixed Valid Invalid Bytes
description: Send stream with mix of valid messages and invalid bytes verifying correct message boundary detection

scenario: Back to Back Messages
description: Send two valid messages immediately after each other verify both are detected with correct done timing

scenario: Done Signal Timing
description: Verify done signal asserts for exactly one clock cycle immediately after third byte reception

scenario: Start Byte with Different Data
description: Send messages with varying data patterns in start byte while keeping in[3]=1 verify correct detection
