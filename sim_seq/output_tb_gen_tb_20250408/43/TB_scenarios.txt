scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: Shift in 8 bits with enable high and verify correct shifting through Q0 to Q7 positions with clock edges

scenario: Disabled Shift Operation
description: Apply input changes while enable is low and verify shift register maintains its previous values

scenario: Memory Read Access
description: After loading known values verify correct output Z for each ABC address combination from 000 to 111

scenario: Sequential Read Write
description: Alternate between shifting new values and reading from different addresses to verify data integrity

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify shift operations occur only on positive clock edges when enabled

scenario: Enable Setup Hold Time
description: Test enable signal transitions close to clock edges to verify setup and hold time requirements

scenario: ABC Address Changes
description: Verify output Z updates combinationally with ABC changes without requiring clock edges

scenario: Rapid Address Switching
description: Switch ABC values rapidly to verify multiplexer stability and glitch free operation
