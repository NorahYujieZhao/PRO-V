scenario: Basic State Transition OFF to ON
description: Assert j=1 while in OFF state to verify transition to ON state with output changing to 1

scenario: Basic State Transition ON to OFF
description: Assert k=1 while in ON state to verify transition to OFF state with output changing to 0

scenario: State Retention OFF
description: Keep j=0 while in OFF state to verify state remains OFF with output staying at 0

scenario: State Retention ON
description: Keep k=0 while in ON state to verify state remains ON with output staying at 1

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset while in ON state and verify synchronous transition to OFF state on next clock edge

scenario: Input Change at Clock Edge
description: Change j and k inputs close to clock edge to verify proper setup and hold time behavior

scenario: Multiple State Transitions
description: Perform sequence of state transitions between ON and OFF to verify sustained correct operation

scenario: Reset During Transition
description: Assert reset during state transition to verify proper reset behavior overrides state change
