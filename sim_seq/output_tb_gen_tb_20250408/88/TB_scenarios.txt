scenario: Basic Reset Operation
description: Assert reset for one clock cycle and verify shift_ena asserts for exactly 4 clock cycles then stays low

scenario: Multiple Reset Pulses
description: Apply multiple reset pulses with varying intervals and verify each reset triggers a new 4 cycle shift_ena sequence

scenario: Reset During Shift Operation
description: Assert reset while shift_ena is active to verify synchronous reset behavior restarts the 4 cycle sequence

scenario: Long Term Stability
description: Run system for many cycles without reset to verify shift_ena remains low after initial sequence

scenario: Back to Back Reset
description: Assert reset immediately after a 4 cycle sequence completes to verify proper start of new sequence

scenario: Reset Pulse Width
description: Apply reset pulses of different widths to verify FSM responds correctly to any reset pulse width
