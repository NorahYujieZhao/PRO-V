scenario: Basic Walking Direction Changes
description: Verify Lemming alternates between walking left and right when bumped on corresponding sides while on ground

scenario: Basic Falling Behavior
description: Test Lemming enters falling state when ground disappears and resumes previous walking direction when ground reappears within safe fall time

scenario: Basic Digging Operation
description: Verify Lemming starts digging when dig signal asserted while walking on ground and continues until ground disappears

scenario: Splatter Condition
description: Test Lemming splatters when falling for 21 clock cycles before hitting ground and remains in splattered state permanently

scenario: Fall Priority Over Dig
description: Verify falling takes precedence when both falling and dig conditions are present simultaneously

scenario: Dig Priority Over Direction Change
description: Confirm digging takes precedence over direction changes when bump signals occur during dig operation

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Operation
description: Test asynchronous reset forces Lemming to walk left state regardless of current state or inputs

scenario: Bump While Falling Immunity
description: Verify bump signals during falling state do not affect walking direction when ground is reached

scenario: Maximum Fall Duration
description: Test Lemming can fall for extended periods beyond 20 cycles without splattering until ground is reached

scenario: Simultaneous Bumps
description: Verify correct direction change when both bump left and bump right occur simultaneously
