scenario: Basic Counting Operation
description: Verify counter increments by 1 on each clock cycle starting from 0 through multiple values

scenario: Synchronous Reset During Count
description: Assert reset signal while counter is at various non zero values and verify it synchronously resets to 0 on next clock edge

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Let counter reach maximum value 15 and verify it correctly rolls over to 0 on next clock cycle

scenario: Initial Power Up State
description: Verify counter starts at a known state of 0 upon initial power up before any clock transitions

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Assert and deassert reset multiple times during counting operation to verify consistent reset behavior

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Verify reset signal meets setup time requirements relative to clock edge for proper synchronous operation

scenario: Continuous Operation
description: Run counter through multiple complete 0 to 15 cycles to verify sustained correct operation
