scenario: Initial Reset Behavior
description: Assert resetn to verify FSM enters state A with all grant signals g deasserted

scenario: No Requests Idle State
description: Set all request signals r to 0 and verify FSM remains in state A with all grants g deasserted

scenario: Single Request Device 1
description: Assert only r1 and verify FSM transitions to state B with g1 asserted

scenario: Single Request Device 2
description: Assert only r2 and verify FSM transitions to state C with g2 asserted

scenario: Single Request Device 3
description: Assert only r3 and verify FSM transitions to state D with g3 asserted

scenario: Priority Check Device 1 Over 2
description: Assert both r1 and r2 simultaneously and verify FSM prioritizes device 1 by entering state B

scenario: Priority Check Device 1 Over 3
description: Assert both r1 and r3 simultaneously and verify FSM prioritizes device 1 by entering state B

scenario: Priority Check Device 2 Over 3
description: Assert both r2 and r3 simultaneously and verify FSM prioritizes device 2 by entering state C

scenario: All Requests Active
description: Assert all request signals and verify FSM prioritizes device 1 by entering state B

scenario: Grant Persistence Device 1
description: Maintain r1 high after receiving grant and verify g1 remains asserted

scenario: Grant Persistence Device 2
description: Maintain r2 high after receiving grant and verify g2 remains asserted

scenario: Release Grant Device 1
description: Deassert r1 while in state B and verify FSM returns to state A

scenario: Release Grant Device 2
description: Deassert r2 while in state C and verify FSM returns to state A
