scenario: Basic State B to A Transition
description: When in state B output=1 and input=0 verify transition to state A output=0 on next clock edge

scenario: State A Self Loop
description: When in state A output=0 and input=1 verify staying in state A output=0 on next clock edge

scenario: State B Self Loop
description: When in state B output=1 and input=1 verify staying in state B output=1 on next clock edge

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Activation
description: Assert reset asynchronously while in state A verify immediate transition to state B output=1

scenario: Reset Release Operation
description: Release reset and apply input sequences verify FSM resumes normal operation from state B

scenario: Multiple State Transitions
