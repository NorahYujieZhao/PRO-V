scenario: Reset State Verification
description: Assert reset and verify FSM enters state A with z output low

scenario: Stay in State A
description: Keep s=0 for multiple cycles and verify FSM remains in state A with z=0

scenario: Basic State A to B Transition
description: Assert s=1 and verify FSM transitions from state A to B

scenario: Exactly Two High W Inputs
description: In state B provide w=1 for exactly two cycles out of three and verify z=1 in following cycle

scenario: Less Than Two High W Inputs
description: In state B provide w=1 for only one cycle out of three and verify z=0 in following cycle

scenario: More Than Two High W Inputs
description: In state B provide w=1 for all three cycles and verify z=0 in following cycle

scenario: Zero High W Inputs
description: In state B keep w=0 for all three cycles and verify z=0 in following cycle

scenario: Multiple Three Cycle Windows
description: Test consecutive three cycle windows with different w patterns and verify correct z output sequence

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while FSM is in middle of counting w inputs and verify return to state A
