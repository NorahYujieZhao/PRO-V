scenario: Reset Operation
description: Assert asynchronous reset and verify FSM enters state A with z output low

scenario: Stay in State A
description: From state A with x=0 verify FSM stays in state A and outputs z=0

scenario: Transition A to B
description: From state A with x=1 verify FSM transitions to state B and outputs z=1

scenario: Stay in State B with x0
description: From state B with x=0 verify FSM stays in state B and outputs z=1

scenario: Stay in State B with x1
description: From state B with x=1 verify FSM stays in state B and outputs z=0

scenario: Multiple Input Transitions
description: Apply alternating x inputs and verify correct state transitions and output sequences

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while FSM is in state B and verify immediate return to state A

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify state transitions occur only on rising clock edges except for asynchronous reset
