scenario: Reset State Verification
description: Assert reset and verify FSM enters state A with output z equal to 0

scenario: Path to Output One
description: Test transition sequence from A to E A1B1C1E to verify z becomes 1

scenario: Path to Alternate Output One
description: Test transition sequence from A to F A1B0D1F to verify z becomes 1

scenario: State A Self Loop
description: In state A apply w0 multiple cycles to verify FSM remains in A with z equals 0

scenario: Output Toggle via D State
description: From state E or F transition to D w0 then verify z toggles from 1 to 0

scenario: Maximum Path Coverage
description: Exercise longest possible path through states ABCDEF to verify all transitions

scenario: Reset from Output High
description: While in state E or F with z equals 1 assert reset and verify return to state A with z equals 0

scenario: Rapid Input Transitions
description: Apply alternating w inputs each cycle to exercise frequent state changes

scenario: State E Self Loop
description: In state E apply w1 multiple cycles to verify FSM remains in E with z equals 1
