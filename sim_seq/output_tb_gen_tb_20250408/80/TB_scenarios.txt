scenario: Synchronous Reset Behavior
description: Assert reset signal synchronously with clock edge and verify LFSR output initializes to 5'b00001

scenario: Basic LFSR Operation
description: After reset deassert verify LFSR shifts correctly with XOR feedback from taps at positions 5 and 3 for several clock cycles

scenario: Maximum Length Sequence
description: Run LFSR for 31 clock cycles and verify it generates all possible states except all zeros before repeating the sequence

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Assert and deassert reset multiple times during operation to verify consistent reset behavior and sequence restart

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify LFSR only updates on positive clock edges and maintains stable output between clock edges

scenario: Sequence Verification
description: Verify specific known state transitions based on the Galois LFSR polynomial for positions 5 and 3

scenario: Long Term Stability
description: Run LFSR for multiple complete sequences to verify consistent behavior and proper repetition of the 31 state pattern
