scenario: Initial State Verification
description: After power-up, verify p and q initialize to 0 with clock low and input a is 0

scenario: Basic Input Following
description: Verify that output p follows input a on rising clock edges showing the immediate state tracking behavior

scenario: State Transition Detection
description: Apply sequence of alternating 1s and 0s on input a and verify correct state transitions on clock edges

scenario: Output Q Assertion
description: Verify output q becomes 1 when the specific input pattern is detected and maintains state until reset condition

scenario: Pattern Reset Condition
description: Verify the state machine resets its pattern detection when appropriate input sequence is received

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify state changes occur only on rising clock edges and signals maintain stable values between clock edges

scenario: Rapid Input Changes
description: Apply quick changes to input a between clock edges to verify proper sampling only on clock edges
