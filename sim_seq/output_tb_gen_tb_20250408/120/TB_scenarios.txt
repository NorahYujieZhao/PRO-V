scenario: Basic Shift Operation
description: Input a sequence of alternating 1s and 0s and verify data shifts through all four stages correctly appearing at output after 4 clock cycles

scenario: Reset Operation
description: Assert reset low during shifting operation and verify all internal flip flops clear to 0 on next clock edge

scenario: Continuous Input Stream
description: Apply continuous stream of input bits and verify correct propagation through all stages with expected 4 cycle delay

scenario: Reset Release
description: Release reset by driving resetn high and verify shift register resumes normal operation from cleared state

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Verify input data meets setup time requirements relative to clock edge for reliable capture

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Verify input data meets hold time requirements relative to clock edge for reliable capture

scenario: Clock Edge Response
description: Verify shift register only updates on positive clock edges and maintains stable output between clock cycles
