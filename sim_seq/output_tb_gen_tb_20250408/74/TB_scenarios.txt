scenario: Basic Load and Countdown
description: Load a value like 5 into counter and verify it counts down to 0 correctly with load deasserted, checking tc assertion at 0

scenario: Load During Countdown
description: Load initial value then during countdown load a new value and verify counter restarts from new value immediately

scenario: Load Maximum Value
description: Load maximum 10bit value 1023 and verify complete countdown sequence to 0 with proper tc timing

scenario: Load Minimum Value
description: Load value 1 and verify single countdown step to 0 with immediate tc assertion

scenario: Load Zero Value
description: Load value 0 and verify tc asserts immediately without any countdown

scenario: Continuous Loading
description: Keep load signal asserted and change data value every cycle verifying counter follows input data

scenario: Stay at Zero
description: After reaching 0 keep counting for several cycles to verify counter stays at 0 and tc remains asserted

scenario: Load after Terminal Count
description: After counter reaches 0 load new value and verify countdown restarts properly with tc deasserted
