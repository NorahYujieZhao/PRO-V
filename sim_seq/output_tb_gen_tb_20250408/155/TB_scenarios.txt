scenario: BasicWalkingLeft
description: 15 clock cycles with no bumps or falls, starting from reset state to verify default left walking behavior with ground present

scenario: LeftToRightTransition
description: 12 clock cycles where bump_left is asserted at cycle 5 while walking left to verify direction change to walking right

scenario: RightToLeftTransition
description: 12 clock cycles where bump_right is asserted at cycle 5 while walking right to verify direction change to walking left

scenario: SimpleFallSequence
description: 20 clock cycles where ground becomes 0 at cycle 5 while walking left and returns to 1 at cycle 15 to verify falling behavior and direction retention

scenario: BumpDuringFall
description: 16 clock cycles where Lemming falls at cycle 4 and receives bumps while falling to verify that bumps during fall do not affect walking direction

scenario: SimultaneousBumps
description: 12 clock cycles where both bump_left and bump_right are asserted simultaneously at cycle 5 to verify direction change behavior

scenario: BumpAndGroundTransition
description: 15 clock cycles where bump occurs in same cycle as ground disappears to verify bump is ignored when transitioning to falling state

scenario: MultipleFallSequences
description: 25 clock cycles with multiple ground transitions to verify consistent falling behavior and direction retention across multiple falls

scenario: AsyncResetDuringWalk
description: 15 clock cycles where asynchronous reset is asserted at various points during walking to verify immediate return to left walking state

scenario: AsyncResetDuringFall
description: 15 clock cycles where asynchronous reset is asserted during falling state to verify immediate return to left walking state regardless of current state
