scenario: Normal Data Loading
description: Apply different 8 bit data patterns and verify correct data capture on positive clock edges

scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal and verify all flip flops are set to zero on the next positive clock edge

scenario: Reset Deassert Operation
description: Deassert reset and verify DFFs can properly load new data on subsequent clock edges

scenario: Clock Edge Alignment
description: Verify data is only captured on positive clock edges and remains stable between clock edges

scenario: Data Setup Time
description: Verify data changes meet setup time requirements before clock edge for reliable capture

scenario: Data Hold Time
description: Verify data remains stable for required hold time after clock edge

scenario: Alternating Data Pattern
description: Toggle data bits between 1s and 0s to verify all DFFs can switch states properly

scenario: Reset During Data Change
description: Assert reset while changing data to verify reset dominance and synchronous behavior
