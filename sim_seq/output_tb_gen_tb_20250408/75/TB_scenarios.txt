scenario: Basic Pattern Detection
description: Input the sequence 1101 directly and verify start_shifting asserts high on the last bit

scenario: Pattern Within Longer Sequence
description: Input a longer bit sequence containing 1101 like 0011101 and verify correct detection

scenario: Multiple Pattern Occurrences
description: Input multiple 1101 patterns and verify start_shifting stays high after first detection

scenario: Reset During Pattern
description: Assert reset while receiving partial pattern and verify FSM restarts pattern detection

scenario: Reset After Detection
description: Assert reset after pattern detection and verify start_shifting deasserts

scenario: Partial Pattern Recovery
description: Send partial pattern 110 then different bits verify FSM correctly restarts detection

scenario: Overlapping Patterns
description: Input sequence 11011101 containing overlapping patterns verify detection at first complete pattern

scenario: Initial Reset State
description: Verify FSM starts in correct state with start_shifting low after reset
