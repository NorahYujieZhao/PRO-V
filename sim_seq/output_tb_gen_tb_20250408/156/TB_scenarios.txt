scenario: BasicCounting
description: 20 clock cycles with reset deasserted to verify normal counting from 0000 to 0019 ensuring proper BCD encoding for each digit

scenario: ResetBehavior
description: 15 clock cycles where reset is asserted for 5 cycles then deasserted to verify proper initialization to 0000 and subsequent counting

scenario: OnesDigitRollover
description: 12 clock cycles starting from 0009 to verify proper rollover to 0010 and correct enable signal generation for tens digit

scenario: TensDigitRollover
description: 12 clock cycles starting from 0099 to verify proper rollover to 0100 and correct enable signal generation for hundreds digit

scenario: HundredsDigitRollover
description: 12 clock cycles starting from 0999 to verify proper rollover to 1000 and correct enable signal generation for thousands digit

scenario: FullCounterRollover
description: 15 clock cycles starting from 9995 to verify proper rollover from 9999 to 0000

scenario: MultipleDigitTransition
description: 15 clock cycles starting from 1299 to verify multiple simultaneous digit transitions to 1300

scenario: ResetDuringOperation
description: 20 clock cycles where counter reaches 0567 then reset is asserted to verify immediate return to 0000

scenario: EnableSignalVerification
description: 25 clock cycles starting from 0895 to verify all enable signals are correctly generated during multiple digit transitions
