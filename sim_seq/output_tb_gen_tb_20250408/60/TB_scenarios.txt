scenario: Basic Counting Operation
description: Verify counter increments by 1 each clock cycle starting from 0 when not reset

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset signal for one clock cycle and verify counter immediately resets to 0 on the next clock edge

scenario: Counter Maximum Value
description: Verify counter reaches and stays at maximum value 999 before rolling over to 0

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Verify counter correctly rolls over from 999 to 0 and continues counting

scenario: Reset During Counting
description: Assert reset while counter is at various non zero values and verify it resets to 0

scenario: Full Cycle Verification
description: Let counter complete multiple full 1000 cycle periods and verify consistent behavior

scenario: Clock Edge Behavior
description: Verify counter updates only on rising clock edges and maintains stable output between clock edges

scenario: Reset Setup and Hold
description: Verify reset signal meets setup and hold time requirements relative to clock edge for proper synchronous operation
