scenario: Basic Operation
description: Verify D flip-flop samples input D on rising edge of clock and maintains output Q until next clock edge

scenario: Multiple Data Transitions
description: Toggle input D multiple times between clock edges to verify output only changes on rising clock edge

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input D close to clock rising edge to verify proper setup time requirements

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input D immediately after clock rising edge to verify proper hold time requirements

scenario: Clock Glitch Immunity
description: Apply glitches on clock signal and verify output remains stable except at valid rising edges

scenario: Data Retention
description: Verify output Q maintains its value during long periods between clock edges

scenario: High Frequency Operation
description: Test flip-flop operation at maximum specified clock frequency with alternating D input values
