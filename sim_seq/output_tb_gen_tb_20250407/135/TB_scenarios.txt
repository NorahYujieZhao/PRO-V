scenario: All Zeros Input Test
description: Test when all inputs a b c d are 0, output q should be 1 based on waveform specification

scenario: Single Input High Test
description: Test cases where only one input is high while others are low to verify individual input effects on output

scenario: Two Inputs High Test
description: Test combinations where exactly two inputs are high to verify paired input interactions

scenario: Three Inputs High Test
description: Test combinations where exactly three inputs are high to verify multiple input interactions

scenario: All Ones Input Test
description: Test when all inputs a b c d are 1, output q should be 1 based on waveform specification

scenario: Input Transition Coverage
description: Test consecutive input transitions as shown in waveform to verify no glitches occur during input changes

scenario: Output Pattern Verification
description: Verify specific output patterns match the waveform table for all 16 possible input combinations

scenario: Propagation Delay Check
description: Verify output changes within acceptable propagation delay after input changes for combinational circuit
