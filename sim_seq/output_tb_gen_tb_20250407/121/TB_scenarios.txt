scenario: Single Bit Detection
description: Test each bit position individually by setting only one bit high at a time in0 to in3 and verify correct position output

scenario: Multiple Bits Active
description: Set multiple input bits high simultaneously and verify encoder correctly identifies the highest priority rightmost position

scenario: All Zeros Input
description: Apply 4b0000 input and verify the encoder outputs 2b00 as specified for zero input case

scenario: All Ones Input
description: Apply 4b1111 input and verify the encoder identifies the rightmost position 2b11

scenario: Adjacent Bits
description: Test pairs of adjacent bits being high to verify correct priority resolution between neighboring positions

scenario: Alternating Patterns
description: Apply alternating bit patterns like 4b0101 and 4b1010 to verify correct priority encoding across separated positions

scenario: Walking Ones
description: Shift a single 1 through all bit positions sequentially to verify position encoding for each bit

scenario: Walking Zeros
description: Shift a single 0 through all bit positions with other bits high to verify priority remains correct
