scenario: All Zeros Input
description: Set all 255 bits to 0 and verify output is 0x00

scenario: All Ones Input
description: Set all 255 bits to 1 and verify output is 0xFF representing count of 255

scenario: Single One
description: Test with only one bit set to 1 at different positions across the 255-bit vector

scenario: Alternating Bits
description: Set input to alternating pattern of 1s and 0s to verify count of 127 or 128 depending on start bit

scenario: Random Distribution
description: Apply random bit patterns with known number of 1s to verify correct counting

scenario: Walking Ones
description: Shift a single 1 through all positions to verify position independence

scenario: Sparse Pattern
description: Test with few 1s scattered across the input vector approximately 10 percent density

scenario: Dense Pattern
description: Test with many 1s scattered across the input vector approximately 90 percent density

scenario: Block Patterns
description: Test with continuous blocks of 1s at different positions to verify counting of adjacent bits
