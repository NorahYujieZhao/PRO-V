scenario: Basic Counting Sequence
description: Verify counter increments from 0 to 9 correctly on each clock cycle without reset

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Test counter behavior when reaching 9, ensuring it rolls over to 0 on the next clock cycle

scenario: Synchronous Reset Operation
description: Assert reset signal and verify counter returns to 0 on the next clock edge

scenario: Reset During Count
description: Assert reset while counter is at various values (3, 6, 8) and verify immediate synchronous reset to 0

scenario: Multiple Rollover Cycles
description: Run counter through multiple complete 0-9 sequences to verify consistent behavior

scenario: Reset Release Behavior
description: Release reset and verify counter starts counting from 0 on subsequent clock edges

scenario: Reset Pulse Width
description: Apply reset pulses of varying widths to ensure proper synchronous behavior with clock

scenario: Initial Power-up State
description: Verify counter initializes to a known state and begins counting correctly from power-up
