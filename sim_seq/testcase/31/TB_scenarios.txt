scenario: Load Operation
description: Assert L=1 and toggle r_in between 0/1 over multiple clock cycles to verify input loading functionality

scenario: Feedback Path
description: Set L=0 and verify q_in is properly connected to output Q through the feedback path over multiple cycles

scenario: Load-to-Feedback Transition
description: Change L from 1 to 0 mid-operation and verify smooth transition from loading to feedback mode

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify that output Q only updates on positive clock edges regardless of input changes between edges

scenario: Setup/Hold Time
description: Test input signals (L, r_in, q_in) changing close to clock edge to verify proper timing requirements

scenario: Rapid Toggle
description: Rapidly toggle L between 0/1 while changing inputs to stress test multiplexer switching behavior

scenario: Initial Power-up
description: Verify module behavior during first clock cycle after power-up without explicit reset

scenario: Long-term Stability
description: Run extended sequence of operations to verify no degradation in functionality over time
