scenario: Basic Addition Cases
description: Test all 8 possible combinations of input bits (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) to verify correct sum and carry-out generation

scenario: Single Bit Transitions
description: Test transitions where only one input bit changes at a time to verify glitch-free operation and proper propagation delays

scenario: Multiple Bit Transitions
description: Test cases where multiple inputs change simultaneously to verify proper handling of concurrent transitions

scenario: Carry Propagation
description: Focus on transitions involving carry-in to verify correct carry propagation behavior and timing

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Test input changes close to sampling edge to verify setup time requirements are met

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Test input stability after sampling edge to verify hold time requirements are met

scenario: Input Signal Stability
description: Verify output stability when inputs are stable and no transitions occur

scenario: Maximum Frequency Operation
description: Test operation at maximum specified frequency to verify timing constraints are met
