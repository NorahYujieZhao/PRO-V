scenario: All Zero Inputs
description: Test when all inputs (a,b,c,d) are 0, output q should be 1

scenario: Single Input Transitions
description: Test each input transitioning from 0 to 1 while others remain 0, verifying output changes according to waveform pattern

scenario: Two Input Combinations
description: Test all possible combinations of two inputs being 1 while others are 0, verifying correct output behavior

scenario: Three Input Combinations
description: Test all possible combinations of three inputs being 1 while one is 0, checking output matches waveform

scenario: All Ones Input
description: Test when all inputs (a,b,c,d) are 1, output q should be 1

scenario: Sequential Transitions
description: Test sequential transitions of inputs matching the timing diagram from 0ns to 90ns to verify complete functionality

scenario: Input Stability
description: Verify output remains stable when inputs are held constant for multiple time steps

scenario: Propagation Delay
description: Verify combinational logic propagation delay is within acceptable limits for all input transitions
