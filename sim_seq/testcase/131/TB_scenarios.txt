scenario: All Input Combinations
description: Test all four possible input combinations (00,01,10,11) to verify both sum and carry outputs match truth table expectations

scenario: No Carry Generation
description: Test cases where inputs are 0,0 and 0,1 and 1,0 to verify no carry is generated and sum is computed correctly

scenario: Carry Generation
description: Test case where both inputs are 1 to verify carry-out is generated and sum is computed as 0

scenario: Input Transitions
description: Test consecutive transitions between all input combinations to verify glitch-free output behavior

scenario: Setup and Hold Time
description: Verify proper timing requirements are met for input changes relative to output stability

scenario: Output Propagation Delay
description: Measure and verify the delay from input change to output stabilization is within acceptable limits
