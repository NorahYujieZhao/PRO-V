scenario: Basic Signal Routing
description: Verify input 'a' connects to output 'w', input 'b' connects to both outputs 'x' and 'y', and input 'c' connects to output 'z' by applying different input combinations

scenario: All Zeros
description: Set all inputs (a,b,c) to 0 and verify all outputs (w,x,y,z) are 0

scenario: All Ones
description: Set all inputs (a,b,c) to 1 and verify correct propagation to respective outputs

scenario: Individual Signal Toggle
description: Toggle each input individually while keeping others constant to verify no cross-coupling between unconnected signals

scenario: Rapid Input Changes
description: Apply rapid transitions on all inputs simultaneously to verify glitch-free propagation to outputs

scenario: Signal Propagation Delay
description: Measure propagation delay from inputs to their corresponding outputs to ensure timing requirements are met
