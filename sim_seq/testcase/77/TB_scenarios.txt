scenario: Single Bit Transition
description: Toggle individual bits from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 across different clock cycles, verifying correct edge detection for isolated changes

scenario: Multiple Simultaneous Transitions
description: Change multiple bits simultaneously (e.g., 0x00 to 0xFF) to verify parallel edge detection functionality across all bits

scenario: Consecutive Transitions
description: Toggle same bit(s) in consecutive clock cycles to verify edge detection works correctly for back-to-back transitions

scenario: No Change Detection
description: Maintain stable input values (all 0s, all 1s, random pattern) for multiple cycles to verify no false edge detection

scenario: Alternating Patterns
description: Apply alternating patterns (0xAA/0x55) to test edge detection on adjacent bits changing in opposite directions

scenario: Walking Ones/Zeros
description: Shift single 1 or 0 across all bit positions to verify edge detection works equally for all input bits

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input values close to clock edge to verify proper synchronous operation and setup time requirements

scenario: Power-On State
description: Check initial output state after power-on/reset to verify proper initialization of edge detection logic
