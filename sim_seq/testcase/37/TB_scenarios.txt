scenario: Single Bit Test
description: Test each bit position individually by setting only one bit high at a time (0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x08, 0x10, 0x20, 0x40, 0x80) to verify correct position encoding

scenario: Multiple Bits Test
description: Test input patterns with multiple '1' bits (0x03, 0x0F, 0xFF) to ensure priority is given to least significant '1' bit

scenario: Zero Input Test
description: Test with input 0x00 to verify output is 0 when no bits are set

scenario: Alternating Pattern Test
description: Test with alternating bit patterns (0x55, 0xAA) to verify correct handling of scattered '1' bits

scenario: Walking Ones Test
description: Test with a walking '1' pattern from LSB to MSB to verify position encoding for each bit transition

scenario: Random Pattern Test
description: Test with random 8-bit values to verify correct priority encoding under various input combinations

scenario: Boundary Value Test
description: Test boundary values like 0xFF (all ones) and 0x80 (MSB only) to verify correct handling of edge cases
