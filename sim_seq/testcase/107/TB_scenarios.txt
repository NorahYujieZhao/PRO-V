scenario: Basic Load Operation
description: Load a simple pattern (alternating 1s and 0s) into the array and verify correct initialization of all 512 cells

scenario: Boundary Condition Verification
description: Test cells at positions 0 and 511 to ensure they correctly use '0' as their boundary neighbor values

scenario: Single Cell Evolution
description: Load a pattern with a single '1' surrounded by zeros and verify correct evolution pattern over multiple clock cycles

scenario: All Ones Pattern
description: Load all cells with '1' and verify the next state follows Rule 90 truth table (all cells should become 0)

scenario: All Zeros Pattern
description: Load all cells with '0' and verify the next state remains all zeros according to Rule 90

scenario: Complex Pattern Evolution
description: Load a complex pattern (e.g., Sierpinski triangle) and verify correct evolution over multiple clock cycles

scenario: Load During Evolution
description: Start evolution of a pattern, then assert load signal mid-way to verify proper pattern loading interruption

scenario: Multiple Load Operations
description: Perform consecutive load operations with different patterns to verify load functionality reliability

scenario: Edge Pattern Propagation
description: Load pattern near array edges and verify correct propagation considering boundary conditions

scenario: Timing Verification
description: Verify state updates occur correctly on clock edges and load signal properly synchronizes with clock
