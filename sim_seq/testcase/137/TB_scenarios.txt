scenario: Reset Verification
description: Assert reset signal and verify the machine enters state B (out=1) on the next clock edge, regardless of current state or input value

scenario: State B Transitions
description: From state B (out=1), test both input=0 transition to state A and input=1 self-loop to state B over multiple clock cycles

scenario: State A Transitions
description: From state A (out=0), test both input=0 transition to state B and input=1 self-loop to state A over multiple clock cycles

scenario: Input Toggle
description: Rapidly toggle input between 0 and 1 to verify correct state transitions and corresponding output changes across multiple clock cycles

scenario: Reset During Operation
description: Assert reset while machine is in state A to verify proper synchronous reset to state B behavior

scenario: Output Stability
description: Verify output remains stable during entire clock cycle and only changes on clock edges during state transitions

scenario: Multiple State Sequences
description: Test longer sequences of inputs to verify machine correctly traverses multiple state changes while maintaining proper output values
