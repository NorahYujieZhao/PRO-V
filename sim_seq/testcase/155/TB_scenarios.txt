scenario: Basic Walking Direction
description: Verify default left walking after reset and right walking after left bump, without ground interruption

scenario: Falling Behavior
description: Test aaah signal assertion when ground becomes 0, and verify walking direction is preserved when ground returns to 1

scenario: Bump While Falling
description: Apply bump signals while Lemming is falling (ground=0) to verify bumps are ignored during fall

scenario: Simultaneous Bumps
description: Assert both bump_left and bump_right simultaneously to verify direction change behavior

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Apply areset at various times including during falls and walks to verify immediate return to left walking

scenario: Ground Edge Transitions
description: Test bump signals exactly when ground transitions (0->1 or 1->0) to verify proper direction maintenance

scenario: Rapid State Changes
description: Apply quick sequences of ground and bump changes to verify FSM stability and correct state transitions

scenario: Long-term Walking
description: Maintain stable walking conditions for extended periods to verify no unexpected direction changes occur
