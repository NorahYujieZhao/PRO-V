scenario: Basic Flag Detection
description: Send the pattern '01111110' and verify flag output is asserted for one clock cycle while disc and err remain low

scenario: Bit Stuffing Detection
description: Send the pattern '0111110' and verify disc output is asserted for one clock cycle while flag and err remain low

scenario: Error Condition
description: Send pattern '01111111' to verify err output is asserted for one clock cycle while disc and flag remain low

scenario: Reset Behavior
description: Assert reset during various input sequences and verify FSM returns to initial state assuming previous input was 0

scenario: Consecutive Flags
description: Send multiple back-to-back flag sequences '0111111001111110' to verify proper flag detection with no gaps

scenario: Mixed Pattern Sequence
description: Send alternating valid and invalid sequences to verify FSM correctly distinguishes between flag, stuff, and error conditions

scenario: Partial Pattern Recovery
description: Send incomplete patterns (e.g., '01111') followed by new patterns to verify FSM properly recovers and maintains correct state

scenario: Output Timing
description: Verify all output signals (disc, flag, err) are asserted for exactly one clock cycle after their respective conditions occur
