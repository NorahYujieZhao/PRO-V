scenario: Basic Counting Operation
description: Enable counting by setting slowena=1 and verify counter increments from 0 to 9 correctly over 10 clock cycles

scenario: Synchronous Reset
description: Assert reset during counting operation and verify counter returns to 0 on the next clock edge

scenario: Counter Pause
description: Toggle slowena between 0 and 1 to verify counter holds its value when slowena=0 and resumes counting when slowena=1

scenario: Rollover Verification
description: Count to 9 and verify counter rolls over to 0 on next enabled clock cycle

scenario: Reset Priority
description: Assert reset and slowena simultaneously to verify reset has priority over counting operation

scenario: Boundary Value Testing
description: Verify counter stays within 0-9 range and never reaches invalid values (10-15)

scenario: Initial Power-up State
description: Check counter initializes to a known state (0) on power-up before any reset assertion

scenario: Multiple Reset Cycles
description: Apply multiple reset pulses during counting to verify consistent reset behavior
