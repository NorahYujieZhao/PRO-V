scenario: Initial State Loading
description: Assert load signal and verify data is correctly loaded into q register on next clock edge, testing with alternating 1s and 0s pattern

scenario: Single Cell Evolution
description: Load initial state with isolated single live cell (all others dead) and verify it dies (becomes 0) due to underpopulation rule

scenario: Stable Pattern
description: Test 2x2 block pattern which should remain unchanged across multiple clock cycles due to 3 neighbors rule

scenario: Oscillating Pattern
description: Verify blinker pattern (3 cells in a row) correctly alternates between horizontal and vertical orientations each clock cycle

scenario: Edge Wrapping
description: Place live cells at grid edges and corners to verify correct neighbor counting with toroidal wrapping behavior

scenario: Overpopulation Rule
description: Test cells with 4+ neighbors become dead in next generation, using dense cluster patterns

scenario: Multiple Load Operations
description: Verify multiple load operations at different times correctly override ongoing game evolution

scenario: All Cells Dead
description: Initialize with all cells dead (0) and verify stable state maintains across multiple cycles

scenario: All Cells Alive
description: Initialize with all cells alive (1) and verify correct transition to mostly dead state due to overpopulation

scenario: Glider Pattern
description: Test classic glider pattern movement across multiple cycles, including wrapping at grid boundaries
