scenario: Basic Data Capture
description: Apply different input patterns (0x00, 0xFF, 0x55, 0xAA) and verify correct data capture on next rising clock edge for all 8 DFFs

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input data close to clock rising edge (within setup window) to verify proper data capture timing requirements

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input data immediately after clock rising edge to verify data stability during hold time window

scenario: Alternating Bits Pattern
description: Toggle each bit of input d[7:0] in alternating clock cycles to verify independent operation of each DFF

scenario: Rapid Data Changes
description: Change input data multiple times between clock edges and verify only value present at rising edge is captured

scenario: Power-on State
description: Verify initial state of all DFF outputs after power-on before first clock edge

scenario: Clock Glitch Immunity
description: Apply glitches on clock signal and verify data only updates on valid rising edges
