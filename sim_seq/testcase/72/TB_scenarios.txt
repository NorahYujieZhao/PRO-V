scenario: Normal Data Capture
description: Toggle input D between 0 and 1 across multiple clock cycles while reset is inactive (ar=0), verify Q follows D on positive clock edges

scenario: Asynchronous Reset Assertion
description: Assert reset (ar=1) at different times between clock edges, verify Q immediately goes to 0 regardless of clock and D input

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: De-assert reset (ar=0) and verify normal D to Q operation resumes on next positive clock edge

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change D input at various times just before positive clock edge to verify minimum setup time requirements

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change D input at various times just after positive clock edge to verify minimum hold time requirements

scenario: Clock Edge Sensitivity
description: Verify Q only changes on positive clock edges when reset is inactive, remains stable on negative edges

scenario: Reset During Clock Edge
description: Assert reset simultaneously with clock edge to verify reset dominance over clock-triggered operations
