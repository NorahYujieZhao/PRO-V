scenario: Basic Rising Edge Operation
description: Apply data changes and verify capture on rising clock edges with stable data meeting setup/hold requirements

scenario: Basic Falling Edge Operation
description: Apply data changes and verify capture on falling clock edges with stable data meeting setup/hold requirements

scenario: Alternating Edge Response
description: Toggle data value every half clock cycle to verify correct capture on both rising and falling edges

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change data input close to both clock edges to verify minimum setup time requirements are met

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change data input immediately after both clock edges to verify minimum hold time requirements are met

scenario: Data Pattern Test
description: Apply alternating 1s and 0s pattern to verify no stuck-at faults or pattern sensitivity

scenario: Clock Glitch Immunity
description: Introduce small glitches on clock signal to verify flip-flop only responds to valid clock edges

scenario: Power-On State
description: Verify initial output state after power-on before first clock edge
