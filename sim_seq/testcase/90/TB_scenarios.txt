scenario: Basic Selection Test
description: Test all combinations of sel_b1 and sel_b2 with fixed input values (a=0, b=1) to verify basic multiplexing functionality for both implementations

scenario: Input Transition Test
description: Toggle inputs a and b while keeping select signals constant to verify proper input propagation and stability of both output types

scenario: Select Signal Transitions
description: Change sel_b1 and sel_b2 simultaneously and individually while maintaining constant input values to verify glitch-free switching

scenario: Output Consistency Check
description: Verify that out_assign and out_always produce identical results under all input combinations and transitions

scenario: Timing Verification
description: Check propagation delays from inputs to both outputs and verify they meet timing requirements

scenario: Concurrent Changes
description: Change all inputs (a, b, sel_b1, sel_b2) simultaneously to verify proper handling of multiple transitions
