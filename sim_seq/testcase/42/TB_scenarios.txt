scenario: Basic Data Sampling
description: Toggle input D between 0 and 1 across multiple clock cycles to verify basic flip-flop operation and output Q matches D on rising clock edges

scenario: Setup Time Verification
description: Change input D close to clock rising edge (within setup window) to verify proper data capture and metastability handling

scenario: Hold Time Verification
description: Change input D immediately after clock rising edge (within hold window) to ensure previous value is properly latched

scenario: Rapid Data Toggle
description: Toggle input D at high frequency to verify flip-flop only captures value present during rising clock edge

scenario: Clock Period Variation
description: Vary clock period to ensure flip-flop operates correctly across different frequencies within specification

scenario: Power-On State
description: Check initial output state of flip-flop after power-on before first clock edge

scenario: Glitch Immunity
description: Apply glitches on D input between clock edges to verify they don't affect output stability
