scenario: Basic Walking Direction Change
description: Verify Lemming changes direction when bumped - start walking left, assert bump_left, verify walks right, then assert bump_right, verify walks left

scenario: Falling Behavior
description: While walking, remove ground (ground=0), verify aaah signal asserts, then restore ground, verify Lemming resumes walking in original direction

scenario: Digging Operation
description: While walking on ground, assert dig signal, verify digging starts and continues until ground disappears, then verify falling behavior

scenario: Priority Testing
description: Assert multiple conditions simultaneously (no ground, dig command, and bump) to verify falling has highest priority, followed by digging, then direction change

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Assert areset at various states (walking, falling, digging) and verify immediate transition to walking left state

scenario: Bump While Falling
description: Assert bump signals while falling (aaah=1) and verify they don't affect walking direction when ground restored

scenario: Invalid Dig Commands
description: Assert dig signal while falling or when no ground present, verify it's ignored and doesn't affect state

scenario: Simultaneous Bumps
description: Assert both bump_left and bump_right simultaneously, verify Lemming still changes direction appropriately

scenario: Ground Edge Conditions
description: Test ground disappearing same cycle as bump occurs, verify falling takes precedence over direction change

scenario: State Persistence
description: Verify walking direction is maintained through falling and digging sequences when ground is restored
