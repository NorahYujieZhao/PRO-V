scenario: All Zeros Input
description: Set all inputs (p1a-p1d, p2a-p2d) to 0 and verify both outputs p1y and p2y are 1

scenario: All Ones Input
description: Set all inputs (p1a-p1d, p2a-p2d) to 1 and verify both outputs p1y and p2y are 0

scenario: Mixed Inputs Gate 1
description: Test various combinations of 0s and 1s for first NAND gate (p1a-p1d) while keeping second gate inputs constant, verify p1y follows NAND logic

scenario: Mixed Inputs Gate 2
description: Test various combinations of 0s and 1s for second NAND gate (p2a-p2d) while keeping first gate inputs constant, verify p2y follows NAND logic

scenario: Independent Gate Operation
description: Verify both NAND gates operate independently by applying different input patterns to each gate simultaneously

scenario: Single Input Toggle
description: Toggle each input individually while keeping others constant to verify single input influence on output

scenario: Transition Response
description: Apply rapid input changes to verify gates respond correctly to input transitions without glitches

scenario: Complementary Operation
description: Set opposite input patterns to both gates and verify they produce correct complementary outputs
