scenario: Single Bit Transition
description: Test 0-to-1 transition on each individual bit while keeping other bits constant (e.g., in[0] 0->1, others=0) to verify independent edge detection

scenario: Multiple Simultaneous Transitions
description: Apply simultaneous 0-to-1 transitions on multiple bits (e.g., 0x00->0xFF) to verify parallel edge detection capability

scenario: No Transition Detection
description: Test static values (constant 0 or 1) and 1-to-0 transitions to verify no false edge detection occurs

scenario: Alternating Patterns
description: Apply alternating patterns (0x55->0xAA->0x55) to verify correct edge detection on consecutive clock cycles

scenario: Walking Ones Pattern
description: Shift a single 1 through all bit positions to verify edge detection across all bits sequentially

scenario: Back-to-Back Transitions
description: Test consecutive 0-to-1 transitions on same bits to verify proper reset of edge detection

scenario: Clock Cycle Boundary
description: Verify edge detection occurs exactly one clock cycle after the 0-to-1 transition

scenario: Reset Condition
description: Verify all output bits initialize to 0 at start and after prolonged static input
