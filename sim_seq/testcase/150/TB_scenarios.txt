scenario: Basic Walking Direction Changes
description: Test basic left/right walking and direction changes: Start walking left, assert bump_left to change direction to right, then bump_right to change direction to left

scenario: Falling Behavior
description: Verify falling state when ground=0: Walking Lemming encounters no ground, should output aaah=1, then resume original direction when ground=1

scenario: Digging Operation
description: Test complete dig cycle: Assert dig=1 while walking on ground, continue until ground=0, verify fall behavior and direction preservation

scenario: Splatter Condition
description: Verify splatter after long fall: Create fall condition for >20 clock cycles then assert ground=1, check all outputs become 0 permanently

scenario: Priority Handling
description: Test precedence rules: Simultaneously assert falling, digging, and direction change conditions, verify fall takes precedence over dig, which takes precedence over direction change

scenario: Bump During Special States
description: Verify bump immunity: Assert bump signals during falling and digging states, confirm direction remains unchanged

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Test reset behavior: Assert areset at various states (walking, falling, digging, splattered), verify immediate return to walk_left state

scenario: Edge Case Transitions
description: Test state transitions at critical moments: Ground disappearance during bump, dig command during fall, simultaneous bumps on both sides

scenario: Fall Counter Boundary
description: Test fall counter behavior: Create falls of exactly 20 cycles and 21 cycles, verify correct splatter behavior at threshold

scenario: Invalid Operation Handling
description: Verify response to invalid operations: Attempt to dig while falling, dig with no ground, change direction while splattered
