scenario: Reset Verification
description: Assert asynchronous reset at various times (during state A and B) to verify immediate return to state A

scenario: State A Transitions
description: From state A, test both transitions: x=0 staying in A with z=0, and x=1 moving to B with z=1

scenario: State B Self-Loops
description: From state B, verify both self-loops: x=0 with z=1 and x=1 with z=0

scenario: Complete Sequence
description: Test full sequence A->B->B with input pattern '011' to verify all state transitions and corresponding outputs

scenario: Input Toggle
description: Rapidly toggle input x while in each state to verify proper state maintenance and output generation

scenario: Reset During Transition
description: Assert reset during state transition to verify asynchronous reset behavior overrides state change

scenario: Clock Edge Alignment
description: Verify input changes near clock edges are properly sampled and produce correct state transitions and outputs
