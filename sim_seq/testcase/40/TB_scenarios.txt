scenario: Basic Prediction Shift
description: Assert predict_valid=1 and alternate predict_taken between 0/1 for multiple cycles, verify LSB shifting behavior and history updates

scenario: Misprediction Recovery
description: Assert train_mispredicted=1 with specific train_history and train_taken values, verify correct loading of new history state

scenario: Asynchronous Reset
description: Assert areset at various times during operation, verify immediate reset of predict_history to zero regardless of other inputs

scenario: Concurrent Predict and Train
description: Assert both predict_valid=1 and train_mispredicted=1 simultaneously, verify train signal takes precedence over predict

scenario: Multiple Consecutive Predictions
description: Make 33+ consecutive predictions to verify proper 32-bit shifting and overflow behavior

scenario: Edge Case History Values
description: Test with train_history=0xFFFFFFFF and train_history=0x00000000, verify correct concatenation with train_taken

scenario: Rapid Toggle
description: Rapidly toggle between prediction and training modes, verify correct state transitions and history maintenance

scenario: Reset Recovery
description: After reset, verify immediate ability to accept new predictions and training signals without artifacts
