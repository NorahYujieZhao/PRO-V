scenario: All Zero Inputs
description: Set all inputs (a,b,c,d) to 0 and verify out=0 and out_n=1, testing the base case and inverter functionality

scenario: First AND Gate Active
description: Set a=1,b=1,c=0,d=0 to test first AND gate's output propagation through OR gate and inverter

scenario: Second AND Gate Active
description: Set a=0,b=0,c=1,d=1 to test second AND gate's output propagation through OR gate and inverter

scenario: Both AND Gates Active
description: Set all inputs to 1 to verify OR gate combines both AND outputs correctly and inverter functions

scenario: Single Input Transitions
description: Toggle each input individually while others held constant to verify gate input sensitivity

scenario: Partial AND Activation
description: Test cases where only one input of each AND gate is 1 to verify AND gates require both inputs

scenario: Glitch Detection
description: Apply rapid input changes to verify no unwanted glitches appear in output signals
